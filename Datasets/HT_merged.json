The tipping point.he already knew the pain of missing out on an Olympics.Back in 2016, when he had set the junior world record with a throw of 86.48m, it had come just 12 days after the qualification cut-off date for the Rio Olympics.One doctor told Chopra he should push through and compete at the Worlds and then at the Olympics and think of surgery only later.He wanted a second opinion, and went to Mumbai-based orthopaedic surgeon Dinshaw Pardiwala, famous for his work with sports stars like wrestlers Vinesh Phogat, Olympic medallists Yogeshwar Dutt and PV Sindhu, as well as cricketers from the India team.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153He said you can push yourself only to a limit,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Chopra says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I was already facing problems of hindered movement.\u00e2\u20ac\u009dChopra then sought the counsel of Phogat and Dutt and after hearing of their experience with surgery and then recovery, decided to take the plunge.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mentally I was in a better space after that,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Chopra says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was no looking back.\u00e2\u20ac\u009dEyes on tokyoThe Olympic qualification period is on full swing and time is at a premium. Chopra needs to get back into competitive action, get back into his groove, and achieve the qualifying mark, all by June 29, 2020.But the last thing he would want is to rush the process.His return to competitive action will be charted only after he gets to that point where he is able to do javelin drills, but it is unlikely that he will come back any time before January. A top Athletics Federation of India official said that coach Hohn is also of the opinion that he should return only next year after complete recovery. Moodley says that the recovery work is going to plan.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Initially we lost about 2-3 weeks because of inappropriate tissue healing but we have been able to catch up and in a way we seem to be 3-4 steps ahead at this point,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whenever we have introduced new concepts or increased the resistance, his body has responded without any issues. He is not experiencing any fatigue, any symptoms from the previous injury. These are good signs and as a result it has kept us optimistic and motivated too.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153From sports science point of view we are looking to add things which will aid his performance towards maximum efficiency to reach further distances. Get as close to the 90m mark and further,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he adds.As they approach a return to throwing, Chopra and his team will enter the most sensitive part of his rehabilitation.Mackay likes to call this process the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153artistic part\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. This is where Chopra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s understanding of his body and his skills at explaining how he is feeling will become critical. It is also the period which will test his mental strength the most.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153When he returns to the throwing process the sensations in his arm will be different because he will start throwing with implements like balls, medicine balls and later with a lighter javelin,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d says Mackay. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The nuance of a javelin is very particular.\u00e2\u20ac\u009dA lighter javelin will feel very different, Mackay points out, to a competition javelin, which weighs 800gm. The athlete will have to make adjustments in his head for that, and continue to listen to his body. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The requirement in that phase is quite descriptive and honest of how an athlete is feeling, in terms of sensations, with that injury. In the initial phase (of rehab) we can take him up to a point and set our markers and tests telling us when he is ready,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Mackay says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But once he starts throwing there is no direct nature of measurement in terms of what we have achieved, and therefore it is more artistic in nature and really based on the feel, subject to specific movements. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel what he is feeling. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a kind of artistic shift. His aptitude will be a big part,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d explains Mackay who has also worked with Vinesh Phogat, Babita, and boxer Nikhat Zareen and witnessed them making successful returns to sporting action.Mackay has also worked with Chopra at different points since 2016, and began with plenty of difficulties when it came to communication\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhen he first met Chopra, he had come with high jumper Tejaswin Shankar. Chopra spoke almost no English, and Mackay spoke no Hindi.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I went to Tejaswin with the English, he went to Neeraj with Hindi and then came back to me with English,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Mackay says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So it was a three-way channel.\u00e2\u20ac\u009dBut now those apprehensions are gone.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153He has arrived with greater understanding of what he is expected to do and why. His application of training is fantastic and his aptitude is far, far improved. He is much more aware of his body and its requirement. And as you can see I can speak to him without anybody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s help,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Mackay says with a smile.There is even a possibility that Chopra will be back to throwing and be strong enough and comfortable enough to make it to the World Championships, which is also an Olympic qualification event, and begins September 28 in Doha. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not at all on Chopra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mind. The target, he says, is not just to get back into competition, but to get back better, stronger, more skilful.To get back and hit the 90m mark straightaway.","category":"business","source":"ht","title":"Neeraj Chopra at the tipping point"},{"article":"A 10-year-old boy who went missing two days ago in Madhya Pradesh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sagar district, 186 km east of Bhopal, was found dead six km away from his home on Wednesday afternoon, police said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hands and legs were tied with a tape and bruises on his body suggested that he might have been murdered,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Amit Sanghi, superintendent of police, Sagar.The SP suspended a constable Bal Kishan on the charges of dereliction of duty after Rishabh Raikwar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s father Ghanshyam Raikwar alleged that instead of searching his son, the constable misbehaved with the family members in an intoxicated state.

Military and diplomatic elements of national power were brought into play in flawless coordination to achieve the objective. The splendid work of India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence forces has attracted great attention, but not, in any substantial measure, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s diplomatic endeavour in that testing time.The background to India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s diplomacy during the Kargil ingress was provided by Vajpayee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit to Lahore in February 1999. That visit was a consequence of a political initiative on the part of Vajpayee and Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. The two had first met in Colombo, on the sidelines of the Saarc summit, in July 1998, and had established a good rapport. Two months later, in their meeting on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly session in New York, they approved the modalities of the Composite Dialogue, and also decided to establish the Delhi-Lahore bus service. After he had returned to power in February 1997, Sharif made efforts to tilt the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s civilian-military balance in the former\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favour. He threw out the army chief, General Jahangir Karamat, in 1998, and hand-picked a relatively junior mohajir (a term to describe those who migrated from India during Partition)general, Parvez Musharraf, to succeed him. At this time Sharif\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s father, the influential Mian Muhammad Sharif, made inroads among the army\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corps commanders. These were indications that the Sharifs may be able to contain the army\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role while India-Pakistan ties improved. Vajpayee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit strengthened this impression, despite some negative army signals prior to his visit, and some during it. Apart from Vajpayee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statesmanlike gestures, the visit also resulted in the Lahore Declaration, the most substantial bilateral document after the Simla Agreement of 1972.As India proceeded with its response to the intrusion, there was no way of firmly knowing the extent of Sharif\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s involvement in the enterprise. It had to be logically assumed that he was fully complicit because of his seeming hold over the army. Besides, incontrovertible evidence had surfaced to show that Sharif had initially applauded the Kargil venture, though his father is believed to have admonished him for betraying Vajpayee.Pakistan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kargil intrusion made no strategic sense. It was premised on the Pakistani army\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prejudice that India (read Hindus) doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the stomach for sustained and difficult military actions. Now, Pakistani analysts uniformly blame a group of generals for Kargil. The problem is that the army has not abandoned its prejudices, and is engaged in the vain pursuit of confronting India, harming Pakistan and the region.Vivek Katju is a former Indian ambassador. He was the joint secretary handling the Pakistan division, both during the Lahore Summit and the Kargil war, in the ministry of external affairs. The views expressed are personal.

That he still manages to make plenty of sense in them sets the 38-year-old actor apart. One would think that the incredible commercial success of his latest release, Kabir Singh, (Rs 275 crore in five weeks and counting) would make the reticent star open up a bit more. Measured, sensible and logical he stays, in fewer words, but with sincerity. Kabir Singh has crossed all your previous box office milestones. Has the success sunk in?What has happened in the last five weeks is unreal. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too much to absorb and assimilate. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too much to think about. A lot to feel. A lot to defend also, considering that while the film became a super hit, it also got wide criticism for glorifying misogyny through your character.The fun of being an actor is when you get to play someone who is far removed from your real self. In real life, I could never be like Kabir Singh in any possible way. The challenge therefore was to find those grey strands in the personality, take a magnifying glass to enlarge them and bring them to life on screen. Those elements were also in the original Telugu film, Arjun Reddy, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why I insisted that the same director be retained for the Hindi remake. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never been afraid of playing characters that would be disliked. My drug addict character of Tommy Singh in Udta Punjab was also quite deplorable. I feel that people should walk out of the hall loving a performance, not the character. One needs to, therefore, make bold choices. For a star who is otherwise liked and loved, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big thing if people watch a character on screen and wonder what the hell he is doing. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a huge compliment for me if people disliked Kabir Singh. To be able to lead people into a willing suspension of belief is the biggest victory for a film. Were there also concerns that since you were remaking Arjun Reddy that had already been super hit in the South, that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be comparisons, and the same misogyny debate that it had to face?What about the fear that the success of the film could start a trend of negative shades in the hero, and for some other filmmaker to not be able to handle it sensibly? If you start thinking like that, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ever be a creative person. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like a situation where one person goes for a driving license test, performs great and the authority gives him the license. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that on another day, that person can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have an accident and crash his car. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take responsibility of how others will behave.

For that, so far as monetary authority is concerned, the law gives us a certain role and mandate and we have tried our best to play that role. We have reduced the policy rates by 75 basis points and we have shifted to accommodative. And shifting of the stance to accommodative itself means a rate cut of 25 basis points at least.

Whenever a fund company launches a new mutual fund, it conducts the launch through a process known as a new fund offer (NFO).\u00e2\u20ac\u0153This applies to both, open- and closed-ended mutual funds. In an NFO, you can subscribe to the units of the new fund, which is being launched, at an offer price which is usually set as Rs 10. So if you invest Rs 1 lakh, you will be allotted 1,000 units. An NFO can be cancelled if the investors do not show much interest in subscribing to it,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Ankur Choudhary, co-founder and chief investment officer, Goalwise.com. For example, equity schemes are required to get a minimum total investment of Rs 1 crore during an NFO. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The main objective of an NFO is to raise capital from markets to further invest in various asset classes such as stocks and bonds,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Vijay Kuppa, co-founder, Orowealth.What is Further Fund Offer (FFO)?\u00e2\u20ac\u0153After the NFO, an open-ended mutual fund becomes available for purchase and redemption on an on-going basis at the net asset value (NAV) published by the fund house,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Choudhary. However, it is different with close-ended funds. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153New units for closedended funds may only be issued through a Further Fund Offer (FFO).In an FFO, new units are made available for fresh purchase to existing or new investors at an offer price which is close to the current NAV of the fund. FFO allows the fund to take in much more investments after its initial subscription,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Choudhary. A fund can have any number of NFOs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153FFOs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 offer price is referred to as a reference market price and is in line with the current traded price. Several times, you will be given FFOS at a discounted market price,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Singh.What you do with NFO and FFO?\u00e2\u20ac\u0153In general, it is not a good idea to subscribe to NFOS because there is no track record for that fund.

In the case of FFOs of closed-ended funds or exchange-traded fund (ETF), you still have a performance history to monitor.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153In an FFO of a closed-ended fund or ETF, the experts have recommend investors to evaluate the track record of the fund, its expense ratio and the returns till date.

It is a feel good parable of the triumph of good over evil. It is about filial love and responsibility. It is about displacement, a sense of belonging, the idea of the other, and a notion of home. But above all, it appeared to me (not Favreau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intention, and not every viewer is a sceptic) to be a narrative about a sense of entitlement.Early on in the film, Mufasa, the reigning king of the jungle, takes Simba, his son, to a point high in the Pride Lands and shows him a panoramic view of what lies below. He tells his son that all that the light touches is his territory. Simba asks, not unjustifiably, if everything that he sees belongs to him. Mufasa glosses that it is his to protect. But we know that it is a gloss; as, surely, does the young Simba. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait to be king,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he sings, soon after. Who wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t? It is his on a plate. All for the taking. All he needs to do is grow up. The mantle is waiting.But a certain sequence of events forces Simba to go into exile. Raised as an insect eating lion who has not had to protect his territory or any of the pride, untested in battle, he returns to reclaim what his childhood friend tells him is rightfully his: the kingdom of his father. Rather, the kingdom his father had bequeathed to him because he is his father\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son.No sooner than he steps foot in the land he calls home, a tidal wave of support rises for him. The Red Sea could not have done Moses a more favourable service. The fact that an evil king, Scar, who happens to be Simba\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s uncle, has been ruling, helps. But this is how it is supposed to be. Because Simba has been a king in waiting from the moment of his birth.

Now, Zorawar, is all set to reach new horizons. The launch of a youth-centric restaurant, titled Younion, in upscale Mumbai by Kalra features 200 shots on the menu to appease the millennial crowd. We got to sit down with the owner of Massive Restaurants, which recently completed five years as he reveals his plans to put Indian cuisine on the global map. Excerpts from an interview.The launch of your new restaurant, Younion, coincides with Massive Restaurants completing five years. How does it feel? A friend of mine once said that what I have done in five years, only few have dreamed of doing in their lifetime. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been lucky to be at the right place at the right time and have been blessed with the best team. We are already in six countries and will be in seven (Oman) by the end of this month. Our goal [my father\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and mine], was to bring Indian food on the global palate. This will only be possible if we open high quality restaurants across the world. With so many restro-bars opening in South Mumbai, what inspired you to open this millennial joint? What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s different about it?I was taken up by the Chupitos concept in Barcelona, Spain, but those are shots bars. In India, that alone would not work and so we added on additional aspects like community cocktails, entertainers, etcetera. The new restaurant will be cuisine agnostic. There are also 200 shots and eight bartenders, who are equipped to make these. Abhi doh bhag gaye (Two bartenders ran away), and we got scared. (laughs). The cheapest shot here will start at Rs 50.While Jiggs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 whole idea was fine dining, it was mostly your brainchild to bring street food to the fore. Do you feel that you are more connected to the masses? Yes, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m definitely more in touch with the masses. But, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just about street food. My father mostly worked with five star hotels where the need of the hour was fine dining.

I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think great food should only be at very premium prices.

In a research conducted in September last year by Manipalcigna Health Insurance, 95% of Indian millennials are stressed at work as against the global average of 86%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s natural for us to go to a resort in a weekend getaway and recharge ourselves for the upcoming week. It is only prudent for us to make calculated plans so that our future does not get compromised. Mumbai-based couple Krutarth Vashi, 26, a process manager at HDFC Bank Ltd and Shruti Sengunthar, 26, a strategic network manager at Tata Motors Ltd, love to travel and take at least two trips in a month. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The type of trip varies with the season. For instance, we avoid trekking destinations when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warm and prefer a road trip or trek during monsoons,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Vashi.The couple has also begun to make custom-made plans for travel enthusiasts and go by the name Mastaane Musafir on Instagram. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Around 90% of our travel plans are without the help of a tour guide or a planner as we prefer non-tourist locations to cut down on the costs. We spend around Rs 6,000 to Rs 7,000 on an average for a short weekend trip for two and the number inches up for slightly longer trips,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Sengunthar.The key to travelling cost-effectively is to plan well in advance. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We generally go for cheaper hotels but it depends on where we are visiting. Last year, we visited Udaipur and the essence of the city is in its royalty. So we booked a room for a day in one of its palaces. Sure it came at a steep cost, but that day we did not arrange for any other activities and just spent our entire day exploring the palace and made optimum utilisation of the money spent. The next day we moved into a cheaper accommodation and completed other activities,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d she added.There should at least be a three months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 gap for longer duration trips or the shorter ones which are expensive. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We also prefer booking refundable flights because you never know what will happen in future,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d she adds.These travellers seem to be going the right way according to experts. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You should indeed not spend more than 10-15% of your income net of your regular expenses. These regular expenses would include your monthly rent and other such payments. So in case you live with your parents, your income net of your expenses automatically goes up and the amount you save in that 10-15% bracket will also go up,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Rachit Chawla, founder and CEO, Finway- a Delhi based financial advisory firm.An \u00e2\u20ac\u0153impromptu\u00e2\u20ac\u009d plan may give you a momentary thrill but it should not be made at the cost of sabotaging your future.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ironical, as the bill seeks to rectify historical wrongs, including a big one \u00e2\u20ac\u201d invisibilisation \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and even devotes an entire section to transgender identity cards that any district magistrate could issue. To be sure, the latest version drops a much contested provision that was present in earlier iterations of the bill. Transgender persons will no longer be required to undergo physical screening by a district screening committee. However, they will need to undergo surgery if they wish to identify in the binary genders of man or woman. What drives the bill to demand invasive and costly interventions on people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bodies before they could qualify as man or woman? The idea that one may not undergo surgery and still identify with a gender that was not assigned to them at birth, requires us to revisit our existing assumptions about gender. According to the bill, to be a man or a woman is strictly biological business, and thus requires equally strict rules of entry. Is this possibly why the bill is silent about the sexuality of trans persons? What then of civil rights like marriage, divorce, property transfer, and inheritance? Not only does such an understanding of gender, one which confuses it with biological sex, fly in the face of what is now globally accepted \u00e2\u20ac\u201d identity is felt primarily in one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head and heart \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it also opens the door to further discriminatory practices. A case in point is what athletes like Dutee Chand and Caster Semenya have faced, when the International Association of Athletics Federations sought to bar them from participating in certain international sporting categories on account of the naturally-occurring Testosterone (a sex hormone) levels in their bodies being higher than the permissible limits for women. Like the international sporting authority, the bill too, seeks to define the boundaries of what it means to be a woman or a man. Like the rules that were challenged in an international court of law, the bill too suggests medical intervention for bodies that lie outside these constructed boundaries, if they wished to fit in. Of course, one doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to undergo surgery if one doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want, you would say. And you wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be wrong \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the top court of the country too, had said in 2014 that any governmental insistence on proof of having undergone surgery to establish one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gender is both, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153illegal and immoral\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.If gender is multifarious and subjectively experienced, biological sex is variant and non-binary. The two are not the same, but are interlinked. More importantly, it is not the job of a bill to categorise and define either. Just as the government heeded the trans communities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 demands to do away with the indignity of physical screening, so too must it recognise the dignity of self identification, even as man or woman. Not everyone wishes to transition, not everyone can afford to. Not every identifies as transgender, though they fall within the umbrella term.

Not only did politicians from across the board and political spectrum, led by PM Modi, pay rich tributes to her, but for a change, even TV channels which generally appear so polarised that they come across as caricatures of themselves, found common ground in their praise of one of the tallest political leaders India has seen in recent times.Of course, the irony is that for all the adulation and respect that she commanded, the diminutive Dixit was neither tall, nor political in the sense the word has come to imply, and in fact, regarded herself more of a party foot soldier than a leader at all! Which, perhaps, accounts for the universal regard and love she was held in. Over and over again, people from vastly differing ideologies and spectrums spoke of her decency, her warmth and kindness. We too have had the privilege of experiencing first-hand her special qualities. A few decades ago, when she was CM of Delhi, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d had the opportunity to meet her at a formal function in Mumbai. Having left the Capital a long time ago, we scarcely expected Dixit to remember us, let alone single us out for kind attention. Not only did she do that, but her warmth turned out to be genuine. She urged us to keep in touch and call on her if we ever visited Capital, making sure to share her contact details and those of her assistants with us. Her insistence had resulted in a pleasant and unhurried breakfast meeting with her at her official residence, where we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d spoken about this and that. It is not hard to see why her passing has brought forth a flood of genuine grief and loss. After all politicians, especially those who have achieved the calibre of success that Dixit did are not known to be great human beings. But Sheilaji was one and the outpouring from even those she opposed or challenged or who had riled against her party, is because of her innate decency. Grace begets grace they say; never has this axiom been better demonstrated more than in the passing of dear Sheila Dixit, when our politicians put aside their rancour and venom and rose to the occasion to bid her farewell.True LiesIt is said of Bollywood that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not so much \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwho\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, but \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwho\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s whose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.

Families are present in all political parties in India, but in many, they are in control of the party. Equally, a majority of the top 500 companies in India are family businesses. But is the logic of family predominance in politics and business the same? If not what defines the difference?Let us take politics first. Other than the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Left parties, most political parties are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153controlled\u00e2\u20ac\u009d by families - the Congress, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), the Samajwadi Party (SP), the Biju Janata Dal (BJD), the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), and the Shiv Sena (SS), to name a few.Max Weber had distinguished three types of legitimate political leadership, domination and authority \u00e2\u20ac\u201c charismatic, traditional and legal authority. He defined authority as power accepted as legitimate by those subjected to it. He averred that charismatic authority grew out of the personal charm or strength of the individual, people obeyed the leader because they believe in him or her. This authority sustains as long as people believe in the leader, and does not sustain post the death of the leader unless converted into the other forms mentioned \u00e2\u20ac\u201c traditional or legal authority. Traditional authority emanates from tradition or custom - a monarchy, clan leader, dominant elite, chosen successor, or family eldest. Legal authority stems from the legal office that a leader holds, an authority that goes when the leader leaves office.In this classification, parties like the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the BSP or are led by charismatic leaders and depend solely on them.\u00e2\u20ac\u2030This was also the case with the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, under the late J Jayalalithaa. Parties that are family-led like the Congress, the SP, the DMK, and the SS are based on traditional authority and survive as long as the tradition stays strong, and the party leaders have enough patronage to dispense to their supporters. The reason family-led parties rarely convert to legal authority is because the family wants to stay in power, and is threatened by any institution that may challenge the family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s authority. They only allow a second line to develop from within the family, and trust only members of the family not to usurp their power. The moment the family members lose their charisma, or their ability to succeed and offer their retainers patronage, the party starts to weaken.

I had written a book before, The Best Thing about You Is You. It was more of a life coaching book. This one is an autobiography. But this is not about a life of an actor. This is an autobiography of a person who has lived life and has learnt lots of things. It is about the journey of a small town clerk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son and the lessons life taught him. I remember when the publishing house approached me. Back then, I was going through a rough phase in my life. I was suffering from facial paralysis and I had almost gone bankrupt. The catch is that the world does not perceive you that way, it does not see that. The world feels everyone who is talked about and written about is successful. At that time, I said I was not a writer, they said tape it. But when I recorded for around 10-12 hours of voice notes, and listened, I realised that I only talked about what went wrong in my life. And some of them are really funny, when I look back at them. What was the writing process like?But if it is the truth, then you may have to ruffle a few feathers\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 No, my truth cannot hurt anybody. I will have to camouflage it.

That is the answer Akshay Kumar, Vidya Balan and their band of feisty scientists are giving in Mission Mangal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first trailer.Mission Mangal tells the story of a group of ordinary people who achieved an extraordinary feat; the cast includes Akshay Kumar, Vidya Balan, Sonakshi Sinha, Taapsee Pannu, Kirti Kulhari, Nithya Menen and Sharman Joshi. The gripping trailer shows how the team of Indian scientists chased the impossible dream of reaching Mars with a simple home science hack, their willpower and their hunger to achieve more. It majorly revolves around the busy lives of women scientists who turn successful multi-taskers, taking care of both home and lab as they work together on the Mars mission with Akshay as the guiding light.

As much as Jyotika tries to shoulder this project single-handedly (she succeeds to some extent), it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s evident that Raatchasi sounds exciting only on the surface, and works only in bits and pieces. For instance, one of the film\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sub-plots about students divided by caste which would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made a great social commentary is never dealt as seriously as one would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve intended.Jyotika puts in an honest performance.The film features Jyotika as Geetharani, an honest, fearless headmistress of a government school in a village on a mission to bring about change and awareness.

Falsely described as a live-action remake, the film is, more accurately, a photorealistic animated demo reel for times to come, when actors and emotion are rendered obsolete, and our entertainment needs are facilitated by one corporation trapped in a circle of life of its own making.For a film that exists purely to make money, it is narratively bankrupt - a shot-for-shot remake of a universally beloved classic that is ironically less affecting, despite aiming for realism, than the cartoon that inspired it. The story is still engaging, though, but it always has been, ever since it was called Hamlet. The new Lion King, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m afraid, is tonally and visually similar to director Jon Favreau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remake of The Jungle Book - a quasi-realistic fantasy in which animals (sort of) talk, but display none of the magic this very basic concept of talking animals demands.Watch the Lion King trailer here","category":"entertainment","source":"ht","title":"The Lion King movie review: The greatest visual effects spectacle since Avatar; a monument to Hollywood excess"},{"article":"Following a well received teaser, the first theatrical trailer for the upcoming horror sequel, It Chapter Two, has been released online on Thursday, hot on the heels of its exclusive premiere at the ongoing San Diego Comic Con.It Chapter Two picks up 27 years after the events of the original, and is set in 2016.

However, with Spider-Man Far From Home, the studio has managed that rare exception \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an Easter Egg-style cameo by film\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mysterio, Jake Gyllenhaal, that appears to have flummoxed the eagle-eyed watchers. Jake Gyllenhaal shared a photo on Instagram of his cameo in which he is dressed in a floral shirt, a cap and shorts, a far cry from the heavy robes of Mysterio. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just a sexy dad outfit.

For those who are still scratching their heads, Jake makes a fleeting appearance in this attire as Peter Parker (Tom Holland) is searching for a jewellery store in Venice to buy a Black Dahlia necklace for MJ (Zendaya). In terms of narrative, it proves that Mysterio was spying on Peter to get his hands on Tony Stark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s augmented reality security system, EDITH.However, there was no callback to the Mysterio scene in Spider-Man Far From Home as is the won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in such movies.

Not by any means. At the end of his life, he made this incredible sacrifice to save the world, but along the way, he definitely made a lot of mistakes and no doubt created some enemies. To me, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really interesting to explore that and the complications of that. And also to look at, in this time of tragedy, to see how someone like Beck can be opportunistic about it.

The government has come up with a draft tenancy law for you and your landlord. So far you must have noticed the focus on buying a property or on home loans from the government. In this Budget, the finance minister spoke about tenancy law, post which the government has proposed a Model Tenancy Law to regulate renting of premises. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is not the first time. There have been archaic laws relating to this space. States have their own Rent Control Acts, which are old and not really serving the true purpose,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Ramesh Nair, chief executive officer and country head, JLL India.The draft tenancy lawAccording to the new draft Model Tenancy Act, 2019, security deposit has been capped to a maximum of two months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rent in case of residential property, and a minimum of one month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rent in the case of non-residential property. The draft imposes penalty for failure to vacate a residential unit. The landlord is entitled to get a compensation of double the monthly rent for two months and four times of the monthly rent thereafter if a tenant does not vacate the premises after tenancy has been terminated by order, notice or as per agreement. Also, the landlord cannot hike the rents in the middle of the tenure.A landlord cannot cut off or withhold essential supplies or services such as electricity and water under the new Act. The property owner must give prior notice of three months before revising the rent value.The tenant cannot sublet a part of or the whole property to someone else. The draft also makes it the landlord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s responsibility to rectify structural damages and undertake measures like whitewashing walls and painting doors and windows. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With nearly 30% of households in urban areas staying in rented accommodation, this regulation will have a significant impact on the rental market. The law, if implemented, will have rules for both residential and non-residential premises. It is early to comment on actual implementation process,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Nair.\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Legal recourse for both tenants and landlords","category":"business","source":"ht","title":"Decoding draft tenancy law"},{"article":"The sequel of last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s critically acclaimed horror film A Quiet Place has finally gone on floors.The news was shared by the film\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director, John Krasinski, who posted a picture of the shoot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first clapperboard on Twitter.Krasinski co-wrote, directed, and starred in the original film based on the story of an isolated family of four that must live in silence while hiding from creatures that hunt by sound.

Quentin Tarantino should have been a very happy man; the Cannes Film Festival waited for his latest adventure, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, to be completed in the laborious 35 mm format, and slotted it in the main Competition. The movie evoked a mixed reaction, but that is how Cannes has always been. Yet, Tarantino seemed edgy at his media conference on Wednesday afternoon. To questions on the portrayal of women in his cinema and disgraced director Roman Polanski, Tarantino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s replies were snappy and rude. He told a woman journalist from the New York Times to a question on why Margot Robbie (who plays Sharon Tate in the film) had so few lines: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I reject your hypothesis\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. Brad Pitt in a still from the film.The director also refused to speak about violence against women, and mentioned Polanski in the passing - as he did in his movie, which many felt was sad given Roman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s magnificent cinema. Tarantino said that he had not spoken with Polanski before making the film.Tarantino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s answers had the dozens of journalists at the conference feeling angry. In fact, the master American auteur never ceases to surprise and shock me. In the early years of 2000, he, as the head of the Cannes Film Festival jury, gave the Palm d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Or to Michael Moore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bush bashing documentary, Fahrenheit 9\/11. Many of us were livid. The work did not deserve the honour, and was seen as a political decision.Once Upon A Time In Hollywood has all the classic Tarantino ingredients - laughter contrasted with mayhem, wit with bloodshed. Only that the director is too much in love with his Hollywood, and he takes his story towards an end that he wants or imagines or desires. Call it a homage to Hollywood or requiem, but all in Tarantino style, though I wished that there was more substance than mere style in the film.

What seemed missing was the Almodovar energy that lighted up his cinema and took us all on a lovely ride through the plot, which was nearly always personal.However, we have to understand that Pain and Glory came from a man who was ageing and had almost thought that he would not be able to work anymore. So, why not we give him a concession? With this mood prevailing here at Cannes, backed a top rating from critics, 2019 may well be the year when Almodovar cliches the top prize.

It may also not be quite right to compare the Garam Hawa protagonist, Balraj Sahani, with Nawazuddin Siddiqui, who certainly looks Manto, and infuses a degree of subtle strength into Das\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 work.In fact, most of Das\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 cast is way above the average: whether it is Raskia Duggal essaying the suffering wife of Manto or Tahir Raj Bhasin as the writer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close friend, Shyam, or even Rajshri Deshpandey (of the S Durga fame) playing writer Ismat Chughtai, they all chip in with fine performances -- which could have, in the hands of some other director, turned into weepy, melodramatic affairs - so common in Indian cinema.Nawazuddin Siddiqui, who certainly looks Manto, and infuses a degree of subtle strength into Nandita Das\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 workManto manages to stay clear of an overdose of emotionalism, though India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Partition was an awfully painful process that uprooted thousands of men, women and children, often taking them away from what was their home for generations, taking them away from the familiar and the friendly. This is what Das gets out best in her latest work, and Manto says time and again that he could never be the same if he were to leave his beloved Bombay. And that is where he grew up, where his father and mother and also his first son are buried. Bombay, for Manto, was the inspiration for some of the most powerful words that emerged from his pencil. He did not use a pen, though he was an avid collector of some of the most renowned brands of the writing instrument.Das must be lauded for creating a film which while talking about the desperation of Manto, underlines today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s religious intolerance and geographical dislocations, placing them firmly well within the structure of her own outstanding work.(Gautaman Bhaskaran is covering the Cannes Film Festival for the 29th year)Follow @htshowbiz for more","category":"entertainment","source":"ht","title":"Cannes 2018: Nandita Das\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Manto takes a hard look at societal injustices"},{"article":"The air feels fresh and pulsating with the action across this picturesque town.

The 59-year-old is in the country to promote his upcoming film, Beyond the Clouds, starring Ishaan Khatter and Malavika Mohanan. In various interviews, during the course of his stay, Majidi hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shied away from slamming either American or European filmmakers for their myopic view about Asian countries, nor has he minced his words while talking about Bollywood becoming a more money-driven industry. In a chat with HT, Majidi \u00e2\u20ac\u201d best known for his films such as Children of Heaven (1997) and The Father (1996) \u00e2\u20ac\u201d talks about his film, Western filmmakers and the importance of cross-cultural collaborations between Asian countries. Excerpts: In your recent interviews you have said that you did not like the way India was portrayed in Danny Boyle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Slumdog Millionare, and you said it was a very humiliating. How have you made sure that your film, Beyond the Clouds, does not get stereotyped as a film on poverty and is much more than that?People coming from America or Europe see things from a higher angle and look downwards, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why they can only see poverty in the first look. They just touch the surface. They can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go beyond the surface, and try and see the values. I believe that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot that West can learn from here. There are some values here they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have it in the West. People living on streets, they are a family and they stay together despite all the hardships. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think West has that concept. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what I try to explore \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the human aspect of it all, if you will. West doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the vision to see the human aspects. They have [a] more formalistic way to see [the situation].Janhvi Kapoor, Khushi join Ishaan Khatter at Beyond The Clouds screeningThis is why Ishaan Khatter performed on Muqabala in Beyond The CloudsYou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve said that Beyond The Clouds will portray Mumbai the way it has never been shown. How did you make sure that you achieved that? When I said you haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen Mumbai (the way it has been portrayed in other films) it was not the shape or other physical aspects. In my films, I use locations like characters. They are there to narrate the story. For example, we have shot in Dhobi Ghat. Now the point to shoot there was not to use it as some sort of tourist attraction, or to show it off from a tourist perspective. But it adds to the script, takes over the narrative and tells the story. So, I meant to say that the locations will tell the story ... not that I have shot in some locations which you never saw in any of the films. How difficult was it for you to shoot in real locations, like the Dhobi Ghat in Mumbai? Was casting new faces \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Ishaanand Malavika \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a strategy to avoid getting mobbed? For me, I always try to see if an actor can fit the character as per my script. If that happens, then they can be a star, and I will still work with them. Having said that, one of the reasons why I went ahead with Ishaan and Malavika was the fact that we were going to shoot in such locations. But it was not the only reason, and It wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been that big a deal if some star was shooting for the same. It is important for me that the actor matches the character. It was difficult to shoot (in real locations). We shot with the local real people, without using extras, to get the flavour and setting.How do you feel about cross cultural collaborations between Asian countries, and how do you see this trend evolving? Frequent cultural collaborations are very important. It is something that happened in Europe years ago, and those collaborations made them verystrong. It has been lacking in our continent sadly. Our continent has more sources \u00e2\u20ac\u201d both academically and culturally. So, our stories will be even stronger.

It is very gratifying to look back, and see how Indian cinema has evolved at the festival. The festival has showcased art-house films and also encompassed a range of regional language cinemas, Bollywood, documentaries, experimental films and shorts.My job entails looking at hundreds of films each year from all over India (in all languages, including Hindi, Tamil, Malayalam, Marathi, Bengali, Assamese, Kokborok and Sherdukpen), Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Nepal and Bhutan, recommending the best films to the festival for selection, and explaining why my recommended films are important. A primarily German committee makes the selection. The festival receives thousands of entries each year, and I work closely with Dorothee Wenner, delegate and South Asia programmer to the Berlin Film Festival. It has been thrilling, through my dual role as film critic and film programmer, when festival selection enables especially indie, art-house films, to find distribution and audiences in India and South Asia.Actors Udo Kier and Joaquin Phoenix arrive for the screening of the film Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far On Foot.(AP)The festival receives thousands of entries each year, from India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Nepal and Bhutan. It considers hundreds of Indian films in languages from all over India. The preselection is done in close coordination with Wenner and headed by Dieter Kosslick.The challenges of programming Indian cinema were different two decades ago.

Indian films selected at Berlin have ranged from mindie (mainstream +indie) films such as Kai Po Che (2013) to Indian art house and regional language films such as Sairat (2016), Vihir (2009) and Killa (2014) all in Marathi, Paruthiveeran (2007) in Tamil, Ottaal (2014) in Malayalam, Bariwali (2000) and Arekti Premer Golpo (2010) both in Bengali, Lady Of The Lake (2016) in Manipuri, Newton (2017) Hindi and Udhed Bun (2008) a short film in Bhojpuri, to documentaries such as John And Jane (2005).

Moreover, it is much more politically engaged than most A-list festivals, backing films that would be difficult to release in India. Its daring political choices have included Rakesh Sharma\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s documentary, Final Solution, based on the Gujarat riots of 2002, and Q\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s feature, Garbage, this year, whose protagonists include a social media troll, a woman he has enslaved, and another woman whose ex-boyfriend has leaked \u00e2\u20ac\u0153revenge porn\u00e2\u20ac\u009d online.

One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. This month, banks including ICICI Bank Ltd, Bank of Baroda and Oriental Bank of Commerce, have cut their MCLR by 5-10 bps. The move comes after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cut policy rate for the third time in June. Here is what it means for you:Home loan rates will not fall immediatelyIf you are an existing home loan borrower, a cut of 5-10 bps on MCLR will not bring down your home loan interest rate immediately. If you have a floating rate home loan and your loan is linked your MCLR, you will have a reset clause linked to the tenure of the MCLR. For instance, if your loan is linked to one-year MCLR, you will have a one-year reset clause. Now, if the reset clause is in May and the MCLR cut happened in July, your home loan will not change till next May. If your loan has a reset clause of July or August, you will see a fall in your home loan rate. Also, your equated monthly instalment (EMI) will not go down as banks usually adjust the tenure of the loan instead of the EMI.Some relief for new borrowersIf you are about to take a floating rate home loan, you are set to get relief. Banks have cut interest rate marginally. Considering that it is a falling interest rate environment, you will get a better interest rate than the last couple of months. However, it is difficult to predict whether you should wait and watch for another rate cut before taking a loan. New borrowers should instead compare home loan rates across financial institutions before taking a loan. Usually, home loans come with a spread on MCLR. Try opting for loans that are on MCLR without spread.Opt for alternative floating rate optionAvoid fixed rate home loansIn the current interest rate environment, you should avoid opting for fixed-rate loans. Fixed rate home loans are usually fixed for a certain duration of the loan. Considering that the interest rate is falling, it is possible that you may get locked into a higher interest rate for your home loan and getting out of it will be expensive since you have to pay a higher penalty to switch loans from fixed to floating.","category":"business","source":"ht","title":"Banks cut MCLR: What it means for you?"},{"article":"Aleida Guevara (58) is a doctor with many dreams.

In the financial world, loans are classified into good credit and bad credit. If you are taking a loan to build an asset such as a house or for your education, it is considered as a good loan. However, loans taken to fulfil your lifestyle needs such as paying your food bills or for buying gadgets are considered as bad loans. Here are three loans you must avoid:Loans to buy food and clothesFinancial institutions now provide loans to pay for your food bills and even to buy clothes. For instance, if you order food through an online app you have an option to differ the payment and pay the total amount at a certain date of the month.These are small ticket loans which would look small in absolute terms. You get a grace period of around 15 days. If you cross the due date, you will be either charged a flat fee of \u00e2\u201a\u00b9250 as a penalty or 3% a month for the days the amount stays overdue on a pro rata basis.However, in situations where you have to pay off a loan with a higher interest rate, you may want to opt for a cheaper loan.For instance, say you have a credit card loan on which you pay an interest rate of 48% per annum. You can consider a personal loan of 12-18% per annum to pay of the credit card loan and minimise your outgo.

In fact, until the age of eight, Johnson was severely deaf because of glue ear, a condition where the ear canal fills with fluid that can cause temporary hearing loss. Although he now jokes that he exaggerated his condition as a youngster to avoid boring conversations, he did have to wear a grommet, a small tube surgically implanted in the eardrum to drain liquid.HE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122S NOT LIKELY TO TEACH JOURNALISTIC ETHICS WHEN HE LEAVES 10 DOWNING STREET: Boris Johnson started his career as a reporter, not a politician, earning more from his writing than from his public service positions. He quickly made a name for himself and quickly got into trouble \u00e2\u20ac\u201d being fired from The Times of London for making up a quote to embellish a story. The ethical breakdown slowed his career rise, but he was able to get it back on track and earned a national profile as a caustic, amusing anti-Europe crusading journalist. He made a few enemies along the way, once offending the entire populace of a major city (that would be Liverpool) with his seemingly off-the-cuff comments. He had to apologize in 2004, while serving as both Conservative Party legislator and a journalist, for accusing Liverpudlians of wallowing in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153victim status\u00e2\u20ac\u009d after the Hillsborough stadium disaster that claimed 96 lives in 1989.HE HAS A HISTORY OF SPORTING ACCIDENTS: Johnson is a firm advocate of the health benefits of exercise and is often seen jogging and biking around London. But his true passion is rugby, that very English contact sport where players try to score points by carrying an oval ball over the opponents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 goal line. Yet Johnson is known for letting his competitive spirit get the better of him. During his stint as foreign secretary, Johnson inadvertently knocked a 10-year-old boy to the floor in a rugby match during a diplomatic trip to Japan. That was not the first time he got a little carried away on a sports field. Johnson instantly became a public favorite in 2006 during a re-creation of the 1966 soccer game when England won its only FIFA World Cup title by beating Germany. When it turned out that the Germans weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t following the script and started to win, Boris jumped to the rescue, literally, by launching himself at German professional footballer Maurizio Gaudino. Sadly for England, soccer is a no-contact sport, so Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moves failed to save the day.","category":"politics","source":"ht","title":"5 things you may not know about Boris Johnson, UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next PM"},{"article":"U.S. President Donald Trump congratulated Boris Johnson, who was elected leader of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing Conservative Party and the next prime minister of the United Kingdom earlier on Tuesday.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153He will be great!\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Trump tweeted.

And this will determine if the Janata Dal (Secular)-Congress government survives or makes way for either fresh elections or a new government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). There has been enough written about the decay of political morality in the state, the spate of defections, the ruthless quest for power on both sides, and the perils of a fractured mandate which created the situation in the first place. But there are two larger takeaways from the Karnataka crisis, which are far more worrying. The first is a complete breakdown of institutions. Each actor in the political system has a well-defined responsibility. The Governor is meant to be a non-partisan figure, above the fray, who does not dabble in politics. The Speaker is meant to be the head of the legislature, who acts in accordance with rules, without favouring any particular side. But in Karnataka, instead of the ruling alliance and the Opposition battling it out, there has been a rather open battle between the Governor -- seen as sympathetic to the BJP -- and the Speaker -- seen as sympathetic to the JD(S)-Congress combine. If individuals representing institutions act in such a prejudiced manner, and disregard the rules of the game, faith in the democratic system itself would diminish.The second takeaway -- a logical corollary of the first -- is that Karnataka represents the erosion of constitutional morality. The Constitution is predicated on the hope that all actors would exercise restraint, and they would submit to due and formal processes in case a conflict erupts. In Bengaluru, over the past week, no actor has observed restraint -- the actions of dissident Members of Legislative Assembly, and the fact that they are being lured by both sides, is a glaring example. And there has also been an unwillingness to let formal processes -- the confidence vote, in this case -- take its own course. This has meant dangerously stepping out of constitutional boundaries. If the example is emulated elsewhere, politicians will end up being increasingly reckless in acquiring power. It is time for the political class to pause and reflect on the consequences of their action.Karnataka House adjourned despite fresh \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdeadlines\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Karnataka trust vote debate to continue on Monday, announces Speaker; BJP calls it \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgross injustice\u00e2\u20ac\u2122","category":"politics","source":"ht","title":"The lessons from the Karnataka imbroglio"},{"article":"Former Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan is among the front runners for the post of International Monetary Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managing director, days after Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Foreign Office was urged to back an Indian for the job, according to media reports in the United Kingdom.The IMF role fell vacant after current MD Christine Lagarde announced her resignation last week after she was nominated by the European Council as president of the European Central Bank.

But Dikshit really came in to her own when she took over as Delhi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CM in 1998. It was a challenging context. Externally, the Bharatiya Janata Party was in power at the Centre. And given Delhi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unique constitutional status, its autonomy was constrained and the local government was dependent on harmonious ties with the Centre. Internally, the old stalwarts of the Delhi Congress saw her as an outsider, and Dikshit had to face factional challenges for much of her stint. And on the governance front, Delhi was more of an overgrown village than a cohesive city. Dikshit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s astute political and administrative skills, warm and affable personal style, and a larger vision, helped her deal with this situation. She prioritised infrastructure, reflected in the construction of new flyovers. She played her part in pushing the construction of the Delhi metro. Under court orders, she oversaw the transition of public transport to CNG -- Delhi would have been even more polluted otherwise. Power privatisation happened under her regime, and while this had its share of critics, it did help the city overcome acute shortages. She encouraged participatory governance through the flagship Bhagidaari initiative. And but for her last-minute micromanagement, Delhi would have struggled to host the 2010 Commonwealth Games. Dikshit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tenure saw allegations of corruption (especially during the Games). The December 16 rape incident symbolised the increasing perils women faced in the city. And the Arvind Kejriwal-led movement capitalised on the increasing disillusionment against both the central and city governments. Dikshit lost in 2013. Her final few years were difficult. The Congress first proposed her as the CM-face in the UP elections of 2017, only to withdraw it after it entered an alliance. She was given charge of Delhi only months before the recent elections; she opposed any tie-up with the Aam Aadmi Party; and she lost her own election. Her health too had begun fading. But there is little doubt that Dikshit transformed Delhi, and would rank as one of best performing chief ministers of the country ever. The city and its citizens will always remember her with fondness, and gratitude.People of Delhi will remember Sheila Dikshit for her contribution to development: Former PM Manmohan Singh\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcA good administrator\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: President, Vice President condole Sheila Dikshit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demise","category":"politics","source":"ht","title":"Farewell, Sheila Dikshit"},{"article":"The Reserve Bank of India will come out with a mobile application to help visually challenged people in identifying currency notes as cash still remains a dominant mode of transaction.At present, banknotes in the denominations of Rs 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 2,000 are in circulation, besides Re 1 notes issued by the Centre.The RBI said that identification of banknote denomination is key to successful completion of cash-based transactions by visually impaired persons.Intaglio printing based identification marks for helping the visually challenged in identification of banknotes denomination are present in the notes of Rs 100 and above.In June, 2018 the central bank had declared that it would explore the feasibility of developing a suitable device or mechanism for aiding the visually impaired in the identification of Indian banknotes.","category":"business","source":"ht","title":"RBI to come out with mobile app for currency notes identification"},{"article":"Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) MP Ram Chandra Paswan, the younger brother of Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan, passed away at RML Hospital here on Sunday.LJP MP Chirag Paswan, son of Ram Vilas Paswan, tweeted, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With great sadness, I inform you that my uncle Ram Chandra Paswan is no longer with us.

Though the date for the summit has been decided, the two sides are yet to agree on a venue, the people said.Sun, a veteran diplomat who served as the envoy to Islamabad during 2013-17, said China attaches great importance to ties with India and the first informal summit at Wuhan last year had guided relations \u00e2\u20ac\u0153back on track\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have to do more just than managing differences and take more initiative in shaping our relationship.

Results of the 2017 assembly elections in Gujarat and the 2018 elections in the heartland states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh suggested that the BJP was politically more vulnerable in areas which had a higher share of rural and farm-dependent population. Instead of strengthening, though, these potential rural headwinds all but disappeared for the BJP in 2019, and it increased its 2014 seat tally of 282 to 303 in 2019. Even in Gujarat and heartland states where the BJP fared badly in assembly elections, it drastically improved its performance in 2019. This kind of a mandate raises questions on the validity of the rural-distress-could-hurt-the-BJP thesis. So what exactly happened? Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one possible explanation.The nature of crisis in agriculture which developed under the first term of the Narendra Modi government was not a crisis of production but that brought about by worsening terms of trade. Two sets of statistics can explain this. In terms of compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of Gross Value Added (GVA) in agriculture, the period from 2014-15 to 2018-19 (3.7%) was worse than 2009-10 to 2013-14 (5.5%) and only slightly better than the 2004-05 to 2008-09 (3.2%) phase. The last twotime periods refer to the terms of first and second United Progressive Alliance (UPA) governments. To be sure, CAGR comparisons in Indian agriculture are not as straightforward as they are for comparing overall economic performances. This is because the performance of the monsoon is an important driver of agricultural production. For example, 2008-09 and 2009-10 were rainfall deficient years in India with overall rainfall being less than the Long Period Average (LPA). Lower rainfall leading to lower production in these years could have skewed the CAGR calculation for UPA-I and UPA-II. While there can be a debate around the magnitude of production growth in agriculture under the past three governments, an unambiguous claim can be made about another important determinant of well being of farmers. If one were to compare the difference between nominal and real growth in agricultural and non-agricultural economy, there is a stark contrast between how the two have moved under the first Narendra Modi led government. While the nominal component of agricultural growth has continued to decline and became almost negligible by 2018-19, there has been a revival in the nominal component of non-agricultural growth.Developing such an occupational solidarity among the farmers has never been an easy job in India, and is even more difficult today, as more and more farmers are looking for a way to get out of agriculture rather than make efforts to make long-term investments, both materially and politically. Unless, the opposition can resolve this impasse, the BJP need not worry about a political backlash from deterioration in terms of trade for agriculture.","category":"politics","source":"ht","title":"Why rural distress didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hurt the BJP in Lok Sabha elections"},{"article":"Aaditya Thackeray, son of Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray and party youth wing chief, is on a Jan Ashirwad Yatra ahead of the September-October Maharashtra elections.

That is what made Sheila Dikshit different and special.

I worked with her during the heights of a golden era when Delhi expelled public transport fuelled by diesel and replacing it with CNG.She was the CM who moved heaven and earth to remove every obstacle that threatened to derail the privatisation of power distribution and unbundle the Delhi Vidyut Board, a den of corruption, to give efficient power supply to the city, and a shining example of what reforms could achieve. She carried with her the lieutenant governor, a delegate of a National Democratic Alliance-led central government and thought nothing of going to meet the PM, the power minister, the disinvestment minister, the Comptroller and Auditor General and consulting every stalwart to make it a success. She backed Team Metro to the hilt and maintained the delicate balance needed between the Delhi government and three central ministries. A masterpiece of forward thinking and deft handling.Always attired in politically correct, pastel cotton saris in summer and discerningly selected Tassare saris in winter, she was always personable but devoid of makeup, jewellery, bindi or handbag.

It has increased its strength in the Rajya Sabha, both due to its success in state assembly polls and recent defections.

But it is this fractured presentation that forces us to examine each appendage carefully, thoroughly \u00e2\u20ac\u201d to take a level of care to comprehend even the tiniest of details. Such care would be impossible to elicit from any reader \u00e2\u20ac\u201d even the most committed one \u00e2\u20ac\u201d if Subimal Misra were to have simply plonked a cadaver before us and yelled, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBEHOLD!\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Instead, through a part-by-part study of the whole, Misra forces us to track and witness in gruesome, haunting detail how each part has been ravaged by illness and disease. Rather than be content with the mere knowledge of the disease that caused death, we are forced to relive the misery of its spread and the blinding pain it must have caused as it traversed from arteries to muscles to limbs. And Misra does this knowing full well that there is no escape for these visions from the vaults of memory. Two Anti-Novels presents a collection of such visions, diary entries, newspaper clippings, cinematic key frames, vignettes and writer comments written by the anti-establishment activist and writer, Subimal Misra. Bred from years of convenience, one feels an instinctual reluctance to engage with these two anti-novels and their non-linear, unstructured collage. But the reader must overcome this emotional and intellectual sluggishness to enjoy the fruits of Misra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour. This Could Have Become Ramayan Chamar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tale, the first of these two anti-novels, is a novella about a writer trying to complete the story of a tea-estate-worker-turned-Naxalite, Ramayan Chamar, who gets arrested during a worker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strike and is beaten and killed in custody. What prevents the writer from finishing Ramayan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tale are repetitive, brutal episodes that betray the violent nature of both his and Ramayan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reality. In When Colour Is A Warning Sign, Misra abandons any notion of there being a singular subject or story. In both of these, primacy is given to the act of writing itself, which Misra calls the true subject, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnot merely creation but the universe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Misra chooses the absence of form to expand and stretch the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccarrying capacity of the text\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. It is a format that is representative of class struggle and revolution and springs from his desire to present the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcraw material\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the way it is and the way it is used. What we see as a result of this are vignettes of protest and rebellion that cover vast territories unfettered from the burden of character arcs and plotlines. It is fascinating to observe how even the characters in Misra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work are not spared the struggle of protest \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a protest against the author and the reader.

But my late father remains the only Goan-Goa-born cricketer to play for India; a good enough reason, I guess, for me to qualify as an honorary Goan. But if you still believe that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Goans are carefree and relaxed in our idyllic susegado lifestyle, then do meet our politicians: The contrast between the natural beauty of Goa and the ugliness of its politics could not be starker. Just observe what has happened in Goa in the past week. Ten Congress Members of Legislative Assembly (MLAs) switched over to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government, and within 48 hours, three of them were made ministers. In Karnataka, we have witnessed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153retail\u00e2\u20ac\u009d defections and individual MLAs being poached and transported from one five-star hotel to another amid heavy security. In Goa, we are much more transparent in our dealings \u00e2\u20ac\u201d so the 10 MLAs made a clean break from the Congress, and the next day, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wholesale\u00e2\u20ac\u009d defectors were warmly greeted as conquering heroes by the BJP leadership in New Delhi. Since the MLAs constituted two-thirds of the 15-member Congress Legislative Party, the anti-defection law did not apply. So who are these prize catches for the BJP? One of them, Chandrakant Kavlekar, who was the Leader of the Opposition, is now the deputy chief minister in the same government that he steadfastly opposed till recently. Kavlekar has been accused of running an illegal gambling business across the Konkan region, and his premises were raided in 2017 by the Goa police. Now, as deputy chief minister, he presumably will enjoy immunity from prosecution. Then, there is the colourful and controversial Atanasio \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBabush\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Monserrate, who faces a serious charge of raping a minor in 2016. Barely two months ago, Monserrate won the prestigious Panaji by-poll by defeating the right-hand man of former Goa chief minister, the late Manohar Parikkar. During an acrimonious campaign, the BJP raised a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Save Goa from Babush\u00e2\u20ac\u009d slogan, pointing to his extended tryst with criminality. Today, Monserrate is the BJP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poster boy. His wife, Jennifer, who also defected with him, has been made a minister. It is almost as if by switching sides, Monserrate has gained political respectability.Post-script:The art of defections was initiated in Haryana when an MLA Gaya Lal changed parties thrice in a day in 1967. Goa still hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matched that individual record, but, collectively, we have clearly shown the way to the rest of the country when it comes to political turncoats. Maybe it is time to change \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAya Ram, Gaya Ram\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAya Monserrate, Gaya Monserrate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and relieve Haryana of the ignominy of being indelibly associated with shifting political loyalties for way too long.Rajdeep Sardesai is a senior journalist and authorThe views expressed are personal","category":"politics","source":"ht","title":"How the BJP\u00e2\u20ac\u2030has become another Congress, writes Rajdeep Sardesai"},{"article":"Is Big Tech headed for a big breakup?The U.S. Justice Department has announced a major antitrust investigation into unnamed tech giants, while the House Judiciary Committee has begun an unprecedented antitrust probe into Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple over their aggressive business practices, and promises \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a top-to-bottom review of the market power held by giant tech platforms.\u00e2\u20ac\u009dIn addition, at least two 2020 presidential hopefuls have expressed support for breaking up some of technology\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest players amid concerns they have become too powerful.Experts say breakups are unlikely in the short term, and Rep.

According to reports, there were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fixed rates\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for specific programmes, ranging between Rs 200 to Rs 25,000. Such demands by TMC workers have led to protests and clashes; the latest one took place on Tuesday in North 24 Parganas where a local TMC leader\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s house was attacked after \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cut money\u00e2\u20ac\u009d allegations surfaced against him. With the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) making deep inroads into the state (evident from the Lok Sabha results) and civic polls due in 2020 and assembly elections in 2021, chief minister Mamata Banerjee is obviously keen to quickly douse the flames of discontent. Last month, she directed party workers to return the commissions to the beneficiaries.The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cut money\u00e2\u20ac\u009d controversy, however, is not just a political issue. It shows that despite improvements in the infrastructure of service delivery, many citizens, especially the poor, still face a challenge when it comes to interacting with the State for acquiring basic and necessary services. This leaves them at the mercy of local officials and political agents. There are two kinds of corruption when it comes to welfare funds and development projects, a former Indian Administrative Officer told me recently. First, when contractors participate in the tendering process for government projects, unscrupulous bureaucrats\/local politicians ask them to add a certain amount of money to their cost. So it really doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter who wins the state-mandated process \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the cut money is always secure. In this way, the official process is not subverted, only tweaked to benefit a few. When it comes to welfare, wrong identification of beneficiaries (people close to the party in power) or adding fictitious beneficiaries to the list is the modus operandi; the Bengal episode is a creative addition to the second one.Fifth, put in place good grievance redressal mechanisms: This should be strong enough to respond to the complaints impartially, and in a time-bound manner. It is critical because even rumours of corruption, if not nipped in the bud, can discredit a programme, as well as the morale of citizens.And, sixth, leverage technology: It has its own set of problems, yet reducing human interface to the maximum extent possible could mitigate corruption to a large extent.","category":"politics","source":"ht","title":"The Bengal \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccut money\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 issue goes beyond politics"},{"article":"One of the underlying trends of the 2019 verdict is the consolidation of Subaltern Hindutva. For far too long, mainstream portrayal of Hindutva, based on Left-wing academic propaganda, has been limited to it being an upper caste phenomenon. Hindutva was presented, at best, as a regressive construct and, at worst, an upper caste conspiracy to perpetuate its dominance. Apart from the deliberate propaganda, the root of the confusion in the post-Savarkar period was also due to the inability of even several Hindutva votaries to realise that Hindutva was a forward looking, modern construct different from social orthodoxy. Hindutva aimed to integrate various Hindu castes and communities into a unified social and political community to create the foundations of a modern nation. But for long, it was dominated by the village-level upper caste orthodoxy. But, still, Hindutva always had a strong strain inspired by the likes of the Arya Samaj movement, which appealed to the subaltern castes. And, in any case, back in the colonial period, campaigns like gau raksha were run mostly by the shudra castes such as Yadavs to assert their social-cultural identity and create a consolidated caste identity under the Hindu fold. Contrary to cliched liberal discourse, Hindutva and the promise of a common Hindu identity always appealed to a large Dalit and OBC castes as it promises to liberate them from the narrow identity of a weaker caste, and induct them into a powerful Hindu community. The appeal is especially strong among the non-dominant Dalit and OBC castes, which are numerically smaller and weaker in terms of socio-economic and cultural capital. For them, only the Hindu identity promises social mobility, inclusion and political power. It is far easier for them to appeal to Hindu unity to push back against caste discrimination, and exclusion, than to form an independent outfit like the dominant subaltern castes.The subaltern expression of Hindutva will deepen further in the coming years. Let us not miss that in West Bengal, the BJP is the subaltern party now, and Jai Shri Ram is their answer to authoritarianism and Bhadralok smugness.","category":"politics","source":"ht","title":"A common Hindu identity has always appealed to OBC and Dalit castes"},{"article":"A letter by the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar asking the police to gather details of office-bearers of the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) and 18 Sangh associates in the state has sparked a major row in the NDA-ruled state.The RSS unit in Bihar has raised the matter with its national leadership.

At the same time, the Court has also said that the 15 MLAs cannot be compelled to attend the proceedings of the house. The order has immediate political implications and could affect the prospects of the Congress-Janata Dal (Secular) government.But it is important to not look at the verdict only in the context of immediate politics. Distilled to the core, the question before the court was the following: is the Speaker supreme and the legislature autonomous; or do legislators, when they feel aggrieved, have a right to approach the court if they feel rules are not being followed? India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s constitutional democracy rests on a separation of powers. The legislature is indeed autonomous, subject to the Constitution, and it is not the business of the judiciary to enter into its realm. By recognising the Speaker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s authority to determine the fate of the resignations, the court has abided by this principle. At the same time, there is little doubt that the court has eroded, indirectly, this autonomy. Its order indicates that the Speaker cannot have a carte blanche when his decision \u00e2\u20ac\u201d or the timing of it \u00e2\u20ac\u201d can have an impact on something as crucial as the fate of the government.\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTerrible judicial precedent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: Congress on SC order on Karnataka rebel MLAsWill uphold SC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trust, says Speaker after ruling that gave him free handCritics have pointed out that by doing so, the court has undermined the principles which govern the anti-defection law (for an MLA, even while being a member, is not bound by the whip in this case) and reflect overreach. But one cannot ignore that the failure of the political class as a whole has caused this crisis. The court should never have been asked to intervene in the matter. But as legal scholar, Gautam Bhatia, has pointed out, because other institutions are compromised, and no longer carry the same credibility, the judiciary has to step in, often reluctantly. Take Karnataka itself. Last year, the Governor, a former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) politician, rushed to invite the BJP to form a government, even when it was clear that the Congress-JD(S) had higher numbers, and gave it a fortnight to prove its majority. The court stepped in, did not question the decision, but reduced the time to a period of 48 hours. In the ongoing instance in the Assembly, the Speaker, a former Congress politician, delayed a decision on the resignations, perhaps to provide room to the ruling alliance. The court stepped in, did not question his authority, but provided space to the MLAs. The more partisan our supposedly independent political institutions act, the more active the judiciary will become. This is not healthy for democracy.","category":"politics","source":"ht","title":"Karnataka: Failure of the political class has opened the room for courts"},{"article":"Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath recently said the state government is mulling a law to ensure that 70% jobs in the private sector go to local youths. Such a demand for reservation is not new: In 2018, Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani said that his government would bring a law to make it mandatory for manufacturing and service sector entrepreneurs to hire 80% of their workforce from the state. In the same year, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray, known for his scathing attacks on the North Indian community and migrants from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, said that youth from the state should be given priority if there are any job opportunities in the state.It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not too difficult to understand --- and appreciate --- the reasons behind demands for reservation for locals: First, the agrarian sector is under tremendous stress across the country, and young people are desperate to move out of the sector. But there is a serious dearth of jobs (private and government). Second, the Centre and many state governments probably doubt the robustness in the industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts when it comes to affirmative action. Several reports --- for instance, the State of Working India 2018 released by the Centre for Sustainable Employment of the Azim Premji University --- have shown that discrimination is one of the reasons for under-representation of Dalits and Muslims in the corporate sector. Third, pure politics; the demand --- jobs for locals only --- are bound to go down well with the electorate. While the impulse of politicians is understandable, local reservation in the private sector may not be the ideal solution to tackle the unemployment crisis; in fact, it can deter the corporate sector from investing in states that come up with such a rule.A better way to engage with the private sector would be to make the youth of a state employable with proper investments in education, health and skill development. Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath is well aware of the importance of such critical investments. He set up skill development and training centres in his constituency Chhindwara in Madhya Pradesh years ago. I visited one of such institute during a reporting trip before the 2014 general elections, and I thought they were extremely forward-looking interventions by the CM. The idea of reservations for locals also goes against the established fact that migration of labour is good for the economy. Many Indian states, Punjab, Gujarat, and Maharashtra, to name a few, have benefited from migrant labour.Last, but not least, it is clear that private sector participation is crucial to meet the development goals of countries. This is one of the key points of the Sustainable Development Goals agenda. India has played an important role in shaping the SDGs, and so central and state policies have to align with these goals. In such a scenario, chief ministers would do well to engage with the private sector in a much more holistic manner, and not burden it with unfeasible rules.","category":"politics","source":"ht","title":"Why local quota in private sector is not a good idea"},{"article":"The Congress on Wednesday said the Supreme Court order on Karnataka rebel MLAs, absolving them of the obligation to attend Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s floor test, sets \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcterrible judicial precedent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153SC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s order nullifying the Whip and by extension, operation of Constitution\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Xth Schedule to punish MLA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s betraying the public mandate, sets a terrible judicial precedent!

But the vote is actually an outcome of the persistent instability in the state for close to a year, ever since the Congress-Janata Dal (Secular) alliance took office. Karnataka had thrown up a hung verdict. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was the single largest force with 105 MLAs, but that was not enough in the 224 member assembly. The Congress and JD(S) quickly came together to form a government, which, at the time, was celebrated as a moment of Opposition unity.But the alliance has been in trouble ever since its inception. The Congress\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 former CM, Siddaramaiah, was upset at losing power. He shares an old rivalry with the JD(S) supremo, HD Deve Gowda, and was keen to undercut the alliance. Within the Congress, those who did not become ministers increasingly began dissenting. Mr Kumaraswamy was unable to impose his authority. Governance took a backseat, even as crony capitalism and alleged corruption reared their heads. The BJP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leader, BS Yeddyurappa, who believes this is his last shot at power, played on these internal contradictions, wooing disgruntled MLAs with a range of inducements. The government has been in crisis throughout its tenure. The Lok Sabha results, in which the BJP won 25 of the 28 seats in the state, energised the party even more, while causing disarray in the ranks of the ruling alliance. The fact that the Congress, with Rahul Gandhi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation, is bereft of leadership at the top, did not help. It is not a coincidence that five weeks after the results of the general elections were announced, the Karnataka alliance started coming apart and 16 MLAs have, by now, resigned, though their fate hangs in the balance and is dependent on the Speaker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision.Irrespective of the outcome on Thursday, the Karnataka episode must rank as one of the most disgraceful episodes of recent Indian democratic history. On the one hand, there is a ruthless BJP, which believes in getting to power at all costs, and has cynically exploited possibilities of power, irrespective of ideology or principles. On the other hand -- and greater culpability rests here -- is the rank opportunism of the Congress-JD(S). It was an alliance born in a shoddy compromise, in which power was the only glue. It was unable to manage its own internal differences. It has run an ineffective government. The (admittedly fractured) mandate of 2018 has all but been squandered and the solution perhaps lies in fresh elections.

One of them was Congress\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 member of Legislative Assembly from Sangamner in Ahmednagar district, Balasahab Thorat. Pawar knew both Balasaheb and his father Bhausaheb \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a respected name in the cooperative sector \u00e2\u20ac\u201d well. It was a time when many in Maharashtra politics believed Pawar would completely take over Congress\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 space. Balashaeb was contemplating Pawar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer but was prevented by his father from joining the Maratha strongman. Bhausaheb advised him to never leave the Congress because they were committed to its ideology. Twenty years later, Thorat must be happy that he listened to his father\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advice. He is now leading the Congress in Maharashtra.The party leadership thinks Thorat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s soft-spoken nature would unite warring factions within the state unit when the party needs all hands on deck in its difficult time. Further, his cordial relations with Pawar are likely to help better coordination between the two parties as they are contesting the upcoming Assembly elections together. Winning the state would be crucial for the survival of both parties. Can Thorat deliver it for the Congress?Though he keeps a low profile, Thorat is known as a shrewd politician. From a junior minister in the first Congress-NCP government in 1999, to the key post of revenue minister in 2010, to suddenly becoming a member of the Congress Working Committee \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the highest decision making body of the party \u00e2\u20ac\u201d in 2018, to now the state Congress president, Thorat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s journey has been surprising for many. He has earned the reputation of a politician who quietly works behind the scenes. He worked closely with Vilasrao Deshmukh, who became chief minister in 1999, and remained a loyal colleague till Deshmukh passed away in 2012. In Congress, any prominent leader in the state has to have the support of a few top leaders in Delhi. Thorat quietly earned the backing of the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central leaders \u00e2\u20ac\u201d most of whom were earlier Deshmukh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s backers. His skills to win over friends will now be put to the test as he will have to bring warring Congress leaders together. The party that saw many ups and downs since Independence is witnessing its worst-ever period in Maharashtra now. Its tally in the Assembly reduced to an all-time low of 42 in the 2014 elections. It could win only one seat in the recent Lok Sabha polls. Several party leaders, including Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil (who was the Opposition leader in the Assembly for the last four and a half years), have defected to ruling parties for greener pastures. A few more MLAs are likely to cross over to BJP-Shiv Sena in the coming days. The party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rank are in a demoralised state. Nobody is confident if the party will return to power in Maharashtra. Senior leaders are still trying to score over one another. The party is facing a cash-crunch.Thorat has been given five executive presidents to help him handle the party and elections \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Nitin Raut and Yashomati Thakur from Vidarbha, Vishwajit Kadam from western Maharashtra, Basavraj Patil from Marathwada and Muzaffar Hussain, who comes from Mira Road near Mumbai, considered as a representative of Konkan region. Party leadership has tried to put together a combination of Maratha, Kunbi, Dalit, Muslim and Lingayat leaders while appointing the executive presidents. Can they attract the sections that they come from? Partymen are not sure.Reviving the party in such a situation would be an unenviable job and leading it to victory in the coming Assembly elections will be a tough task.

The son of tea garden workers from a tribe that was uprooted from its homeland in what is now Jharkhand and made to settle in the foothills of the Himalayas by the British, 14-year-old Barla had little choice but to follow his friends and relatives into a tea garden job in north Bengal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dooars region. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We had been doing this job for four generations.

Their cramped two-bedroom house, where Barla, 43, still lives, was provided by the Lakhipara tea estate and, therefore, is contingent on the family continuing to pick tea leaves. Barla started helping around the estate, but soon felt restless. Around him, ambitious young people left homes to pursue their dreams in newly liberalised India, while his friends languished as jobs shrunk in industry-starved north Bengal. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It felt like we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the right to become doctors or engineers.\u00e2\u20ac\u009dHe plunged into local politics in 2007, joining the Akhil Bharatiya Adivasi Vikas Parishad (ABAVP).

People voted either for or against Prime Minister Narendra Modi. But Modi understands the fact that political waves have their limitations, and, after a while, they start reversing the course. Therefore, to win future elections, it is important that MPs are made accountable to the people. That is the reason why Modi has asked Bharatiya Janata Party MPs to organise a 150-km long foot march in their constituencies, from Gandhi Jayanti (October 2) to Patel Jayanti (October 31).The saffron party plans to use the march to spread the ideology of Gandhi; they will also plant trees during the march.But the political meaning of the march is deep.

The Congress, in contrast, almost repeated its underwhelming performance of 2014, winning just 52 Lok Sabha seats against the BJP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tally of 303.The 2019 results are far more significant than the BJP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2014 victory. This is because they point towards a decisive pro-BJP shift in India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s polity. Had the BJP suffered reverses in these elections, the 2014 mandate could have been dismissed as an aberration. That the BJP has not only repeated its 2014 performance, but improved upon it, shows a clear ideological traction for its politics. The 2019 rout of the Congress is also slightly more intriguing than its 2014 defeat. The party did not face anti-incumbency this time like it did in 2014. The loss came within months of Congress victories in the heartland states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh in direct fights against BJP. That the BJP bounced back from its defeats, including in the heartland states, suggests that the electorate treated Narendra Modi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s candidature for the prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post differently than that of BJP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief ministers in these states. Such differential treatment is not very common in India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political history. An analysis published in HT by Gilles Verniers from Ashoka University shows that out of the 23 pairs of state and Lok Sabha elections held within less than a year since 1988, the party that won the state election went on to win the Lok Sabha election 80% of the times. A pro-incumbency and personality-centric mandate for the BJP calls for a serious analysis of the 2019 verdict at many levels. Most politicians from the opposition have not bothered to do this until now. Rahul Gandhi, who has quit as the president of the Congress party, is an exception. A four-page letter released by Gandhi on 3 July, gives a glimpse of his interpretation of the 2019 verdict. He has attributed the BJP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory to institutional capture by the (BJP) government and poor organisational effort by the Congress, without acknowledging any need to rethink the politics of the Congress (especially between 2014 and 2019).What does the discussion so far tell us about the future of anti-BJP politics in India? Like Gramsci tells us, political struggle is permanent in nature. It is up to the Congress and other anti-BJP forces to decide whether and how they plan to intensify these struggles, especially against the BJP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hindu consolidation plank in the days to come.

Massive scientific evidence, both globally and within India, clearly demonstrate that human colonization has been a major driver of habitat loss and species extinctions. This evidence for global modification of nature by hunter-gatherers spreading out of Africa, goes back over 60,000 years. In the centuries that followed, initially aided by simple tools like fire, axe and the plow and later by modern technology humans succeeded in increasing the capacity of land to support their populations at densities hundreds of times higher, all at the expense of wild nature. The airbrushing of this massive evidence, with vague assertions of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thousands of years of harmonious co-existence\u00e2\u20ac\u009d is just a thin academic fig leaf. A strong value judgment rooted in a Judeo-Christian belief that all of nature was created for the benefit of humans lies at the heart of this clever logic: that rights of humans (and their domesticated animals) shall always prevail over other wild species. As conservationists our values are aligned more with those of the FRA case petitioners: threatened wild species have a right to survive, at least in the last 10% of India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s land that is now under the assault from rural land grab, industrial growth and infrastructure development.Historically, giving away forest land to constituents was the norm under all political dispensations: It increased food production and kept social peace.

There aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any easy resolutions. Cities have defied norms and stereotypes, and writing about them ought to enable newer insights into unknown aspects, the seamier underbellies that lie far removed from the many accounts that bring to life the pavements and its many activities amongst other issues that remain peripheral. But how does one do it? Should it be a plain city narrative with some historical quirks and sociological data? Or could we locate such writing in the politics of the city and an associated movement? Every writer has her politics and writing is often an extension or embodiment of her political will. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to sound prescriptive but Maitreyee Bhattacharjee Chowdhury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s illuminating book The Hungryalists \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The Poets Who Sparked A Revolution is in that vein. Besides being a combination of a biography and analytical study of the poetry and poets of The Hungryalist or Hungry Generation Poets who took the genteel Bengali bhadralok literary establishment in Kolkata by storm in the early 1960s, it also presents a portrait of the city like few other contemporary attempts. The 1960s was a period of great turmoil. Kolkata grappled with a saga of unending problems \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the refugee crisis, growing disillusionment of the youth, unemployment and a complete dissonance with an effete political system. The poetry of The Hungry Generation expressed this widespread anguish. It was written in the language spoken on the streets devoid of poetic embellishments. They rejected the European modernist sensibility, which had influenced many Bengali poets of the time and shaped a counter aesthetic which shocked and greatly offended the intelligentsia of the city who branded their poetry as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccrass\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmediocre\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsensationalist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Hungryalist poetry was a conscious attempt to offend the custodians of culture. In her introduction, the author writes, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153By the time they were done, the world recognized them as the most politically trenchant, culturally influential and innovative artists, whose lives spanned an extraordinary frame, thus changing the larger picture for many. These poets were eccentric, contingent rebels, and these movements were not alternative lifestyles, but life itself.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Author Maitreyee Bhattacharjee Chowdhury(Courtesy Penguin)The Hungryalist rivalry with the famous Krittibash group lead by the noted poet and writer Sunil Gangopadhyay is captured in vivid detail in the book. Gangopadhyay, who was initially supportive of the poetry of the Hungryalists, turned hostile. Their differences seemed unbridgeable though Gangopadhyay was the publisher of Hungryalist proponent Malay Roy Choudhury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debut book of poems. Other noted names such as Sandipan Chattopadhyay and Shakti Chattopadhyay eventually left the movement. Some of them were lured by jobs and others wanted to avoid political rivalries that the movement brewed for itself and its members. Allegations apart, the verse of the Hungryalists feels even more relevant in the current bleak political scenario of the country. Benoy Majumdar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Phire Esho Chaka or Bhaskar Chakraborty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poems speak to us more now than ever. Shakti Chattopadhyay is never dated. Malay Roy Choudhury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sense of dejection is even more palpable now. The book also discusses Allen Ginsberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit to India in 1961 with his lover Peter Orlovsky. They soon became friends with the Hungryalist poets and travelled with them to rural Bengal and spots in Kolkata city. When Malay Roy Choudhury and other Hungryalist poets were arrested by the Police in 1964 on charges of obscenity and subterfuge, Ginsberg organized support for them and wrote to several others asking for their immediate release.","category":"politics","source":"ht","title":"Review: The Hungryalists by Maitreyee Bhattacharjee Chowdhury"},{"article":"Amit Shah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit to Kashmir in June was his first visit to the Valley as Union home minister, but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t his first engagement with the troubled state.

Interestingly, he dismisses the Pakistan-backed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcjihad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as opportunistic, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a secular rivalry over borders\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, condemns Pakistan as a puppet of the United States, and warns fighters in Kashmir that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Pakistan army and government\u00e2\u20ac\u009d are only \u00e2\u20ac\u0153interested in exploiting the mujahideen for specific political objectives, only to dump or persecute them later\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.

While no terrorist threat should ever be underestimated, the dangers and consequences of overestimation \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and potential overreaction \u00e2\u20ac\u201d are just as great. Crucially, within the broad environment of communal polarisation in the state, Zawahiri\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement can easily feed into the politics that seeks to demonise all Kashmiris as part of, or sympathetic to, a global jihadist movement. Nothing could be further from the truth. The reality is, al Qaeda has been trying to make inroads into India \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and specifically into Kashmir \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at least since 1996, when Osama bin Laden referred to India in general, and Kashmir and Assam in particular, among regions where Muslims were living under \u00e2\u20ac\u0153oppression\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, and as legitimate theatres of jihad. Numerous similar exhortations followed including, prominently, bin Laden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s articulation, in 2006, of the theory of a global \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crusader-Zionist-Hindu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 conspiracy, where he declared, inter alia, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is the duty for the Umma\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 to establish jihad, particularly in Iraq, Palestine, Afghanistan, Sudan, Kashmir and Chechnya.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d After bin Laden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s killing at Abottabad in Pakistan in 2011, the mantle of leadership has fallen on the lacklustre Zawahiri. Despite his persistent efforts and exhortations, including the formation of the Al Qaeda in the Indian Sub-continent (AQIS) in 2014, the group has secured almost no traction on Indian soil, beyond the ambiguous and operationally ineffectual AGH. It is useful to recall that the now-deceased AGH leader Zakir Musa had flirted with the idea of joining the Islamic State, before he eventually pledged his troth to al Qaeda. Musa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s group is, in fact, best seen as a disgruntled splinter of the Hizb-ul-Mujahiddeen, which sought prominence through affiliation with a global jihadist grouping, and, after floundering about for a bit, eventually settled on al Qaeda. Little strategic advantage accrued to AGH as a result, and not a single significant operation in J&K is attributed to this group, though it has been implicated in a grenade attack on a police station in Punjab.editor and publisher, Faultlines: The KPS Gill Journal of Conflict & ResolutionThe views expressed are personal","category":"politics","source":"ht","title":"Opinion | Al Qaeda saga of failure in India"},{"article":"With the numbers that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has, the Budget it presented on July 5 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153should have been bolder\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, Congress leader P Chidambaram said on Thursday.Chidambaram has in the past week labelled finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unusually opaque\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for not disclosing the total revenue, the total expenditure, the fiscal deficit, the revenue deficit, the additional revenue mobilisation or the financial concessions.He had also said it was rare that a Budget speech did not disclose the allocations to important programmes such as MGNREGA, mid-day meal scheme, health care, and to vulnerable sections. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The economy is weak and the budget speech is insipid,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d the former finance minister said in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday in his 30-minute speech during the debate on the Union Budget 2019 that drew from politics and economy.","category":"politics","source":"ht","title":"BJP could have been bold given its number in House: P Chidambaram during debate on Budget"},{"article":"Pune municipal commissioner, Saurabh Rao on Wednesday, called a meeting to address the long standing issue of the beautification of Taljai hills and get an on-ground picture of the present situation.

The resignation of Rahul Gandhi as party president has sparked a lot of speculation and discussion on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153what now?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. This is quite natural. What, however, seems a bit unnatural is the scale of the response and reaction. After all, this is not the first time the grand old party has been in the midst of a crisis which has led to the prophets of doom virtually writing it off. The assassination of Mahatama Gandhi and the revolt against Indira Gandhi that culminated in the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s split were some examples. However, one remembers how the party has defied the predictions of doom to emerge stronger, better, and bigger through every crisis.

Barely three months before the crucial assembly elections, the party seems to be leaderless and directionless. Ashok Chavan has stepped down as state president and the party leadership is yet to decide on his successor. Going by the grapevine, Balasaheb Thorat is the frontrunner. Some sections say Sushilkumar Shinde would return as the state Congress chief, as the party top brass is considering a Dalit face to counter Prakash Ambedkar, whose Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi has become a headache for the party. Party leaders say they are expecting an announcement soon. Whoever comes as state chief, he or she will have an unenviable task to handle, considering the problems the party is facing. Here is a look:Divided leadersFor years, the joke in the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political circles was that the Congress leaders fight each other tooth and nail when they are in power, but come together when they are in danger of losing it. Not anymore. It was seen in the last few years that the Congress leaders would do anything to end each other, even at the cost of the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest. Since 2014, after the party lost power in the state miserably, top leaders in the state rarely came together to work out a strategy to revive the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fortunes that was till recently considered as the Congress bastion. Even in the recent Lok Sabha elections, when Congress president Rahul Gandhi was appealing people to vote for the party to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153save the constitution\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, his party leaders in Maharashtra were working at cross purposes.Traditional voters turning their back In Maharashtra, Marathas, Dalits, tribals, minorities and sections from several other communities were traditional voters of the party. Over the years, the party has been losing support of these sections. As of now, there is no single group or community which is solidly standing behind the Congress. After sitting on the issue of Maratha reservation for a long time, a half-hearted attempt was made to give reservation just ahead of the assembly elections in 2014. But, the community, was not impressed. The party has been relying on the same old leaders and the same old tactics to win over various support groups. Little wonder, in view of BJP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong outreach attempts and increasing young population, it did not yield the desired results.No aggressionThe party leaders as well as its rank and file showed little aggression while in the Opposition, in past five years. Its leaders rarely tried to corner the BJP-Sena government over various issues, either in the legislature or on the streets. They failed to create an impression that the party is an option to the BJP. The party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance as the main Opposition party in the assembly was disastrous. At times, its ally, the Nationalist Congress Party seemed more aggressive against the government than the Congress.

We have been criticised for our collective silence on the stinging social issues of our time, or we have been called out for celebrating regressive aspects of Indian traditions and practices, and legitimising problematic violence. A pretty long way to have come from the Bollywood of Majrooh Sultanpuri, who spent time in jail, because he refused to apologise for a nazm critiquing the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. It is worth noting that Majrooh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bollywood career did not bear the brunt of his run-in with the government.But last week, from this seemingly spineless Bollywood, came a surprisingly brave and unblinking film. With Article 15, mainstream Bollywood has finally let go of its caste blind spot. Article 15 is not the first Hindi film, and certainly not the first Indian film, to have dealt with the issue and the experienced reality of caste in India. In no particular order, we have had Aakrosh, Sadgati and Damul (Hindi), Samskaara and ChomanaDudi (Kannada), Fandry and Sairat (Marathi); among many more that I must admit I have not watched. Largely, however, these films have remained within the New Wave and Art House categorisations of cinema and, barring Sairat, are not remembered for competitive box office performances.And so I say, Article 15 is the bravest mainstream Bollywood film of the decade.Inspired closely by the gruesome Badaun rape case of 2014, Article 15 is the story of how a privileged, clueless, newly appointed, upright cop discovers the sinister depths at which caste discrimination operates in India. Unlike Masaan, which was a more internal and psychological look at caste, Article 15 places caste front and centre as it explores power equations in social relations.","category":"politics","source":"ht","title":"With Article 15, Bollywood, finally, sheds its caste blind spot"},{"article":"In the summer of 2015, the former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), Mufti Mohammad Sayeed tasked me, as his adviser, to coordinate with Ram Madhav, the Bharatiya Janata Party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general secretary for J&K, to organise a meeting with Kashmir Pandit (KP) leaders, primarily from the Sangh Parivar. It was intended as the first step in building trust that would eventually help in the dignified return of the Kashmiri Pandits. The chief minister spelt out his policy and vision to the KP leadership: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You do not need us. We need you. Aap aabad hain, jahan bhi hain (you have shown your mettle, wherever you have gone). But we, without the diversity you contributed to the Valley, without our syncretic culture, are the ones really exiled.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Mufti reiterated these ideas, in my presence, over breakfast with Rashtriya Swayamsangh Parivar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sah sarkaryavah, Krishna Gopal. That meeting and those dreams faded with the passing away of Mufti and the manner in which his political legacy was frittered away.The visit of the Union home minister Amit Shah to Srinagar and his intervention on J&K in the two Houses of Parliament has, counter-intuitively, rekindled those hopes. Shah explicitly expressed the Centre\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to win over the hearts and the minds of the people of J&K through an inclusive vision. By giving a real stake in the stability, prosperity and future of the state; by providing honest governance and state-of-the-art infrastructure; by empowering the youth; and through a return to the traditional values that have defined Kashmiriyat: a unique blend of Shavism with Sufi thought. Shah could have even done better and quoted from the mystical 14th century poet, Lal Ded: Shiv chu thal thal rozana, mozan hund tu muslmaan (Shiva is like the sun; his radiance makes no distinction between Hindus and Muslims).What is also unequivocally clear is that J&K is on top of Shah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agenda , and that it will finally receive the attention that it deserves without the shoddiness of the bureaucratic confusion that has traditionally mired the Centre\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s engagement with the state. As arguably the most powerful home minister since Sardar Patel, Shah will, at the very least, ensure that imperious bureaucrats, with imperial ambitions but with the mindset of section officers, do not prevail. In substance, Amit Shah has quickly discovered that J&K is fundamentally about politics, and where the personal is and has been the political long before social scientists discovered this rather mundane reality. And that bad politics has consistently been allowed to overwhelm good politics.All this will not be easy and will test Shah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s skills, political will and the Centre\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment . Kashmir is not for nothing considered a graveyard of reputations. And the real test of the Shah doctrine will be in the inclusiveness of the participation in the forthcoming assembly elections. Most importantly, Shah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s greatest challenge is that aspects of J&K\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems are addressed not through unilaterally forced constitutional measures, but when the majority of the people of J&K themselves realise that greater integration with the mainland will provide them with more opportunities, provide more freedom and space and strengthen their rights much more than the dystopian dream of azadi.Amitabh Mattoo is author, most recently, of Empowering Youth of Jammu & Kashmir: Education, Engagement and Employability The views expressed are personal","category":"politics","source":"ht","title":"Amit Shah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Valley challenge: Avoiding unilateral forced constitutional measures"},{"article":"Already grappling with parking woes, Shimla residents are facing a tough time after a government order prohibiting parking on road side, especially the office-goers.Policesurveys say thatnearly 10,000 vehicles in Shimla are parked on both lateral and main roads, leading to traffic congestion and jams.

It would have been understandable if the party, flush with victory, decided to step back. Leaders and the cadre could have easily slid into complacency, enjoying the privileges of power and rested easy till the next round of the elections. It was the Opposition which, one assumed, would be driven to action \u00e2\u20ac\u201d introspecting, understanding reasons for their failure, going back to the ground, strengthening their organisation, reaching out to social groups and individuals, and selecting new leaders. What is happening in Indian politics is, however, just the reverse. On Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi kicked off a fresh membership drive for the BJP in Varanasi. In 2014, soon after Amit Shah took over as the party president, the BJP embarked on a similar exercise. What could have just turned out to be a customary process ended up as a mega campaign. That led to the formal enrolment in the party hitting close to 100 million members \u00e2\u20ac\u201d prompting Mr Shah to claim that the BJP was the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest party. Many doubted the veracity of the figure, but there was little doubt that the campaign kept the party machine active, swelled its ranks, and gave it access to formidable data \u00e2\u20ac\u201d mobile numbers, addresses, and demographic profile of its entire structure. This data was then used for the various campaigns the party did over the past five years and in elections. After the 2019 victory, the party has started another similar drive. The moment is ripe, for given, Mr Modi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s popularity and the sheer dominance it enjoys in Indian politics at the moment, many are sure to gravitate towards the party. This will then be followed by a process of internal elections. The BJP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claims of democracy here however can be questioned \u00e2\u20ac\u201d most office bearers from the national level to the district level are selected by consensus rather than internal polls. But nonetheless, this will create a pool of new leaders, generate political opportunities for many, and culminate in the election of a new party president by early next year. Working president JP Nadda is most likely to succeed Mr Shah. The BJP clearly has its eyes set on both strengthening the organisation, and preparing for upcoming polls.

He made his first-class debut in 1999 while he was in class 12 at New Delhi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Modern School (Barakhamba Road). Four years later, he made it to the next level when he played his first international one-day match for India against Bangladesh in Dhaka in April 2003. Gambhir went from strength to strength to emerge as the number 1 ranked test cricket player in 2009. A year earlier, the left-handed batsman won India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second highest sporting prize \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Arjun Award.

India played 11 international friendlies between January to March, in Hong Kong, Indonesia, Turkey and at home in the Gold Cup invitational tournament. These games were organised to prepare for the SAFF Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Championship and the second round of Olympic qualifiers for which India had qualified for the first time. These international matches were made possible after the Sports Authority of India (SAI) signed an agreement with AIFF last year to fund exposure trips for women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s football.The team went on to successfully defend the SAFF title, making it five titles in as many editions. India failed to progress to the next stage of the Olympic qualifiers by a whisker, losing out on goal difference after a 3-3 draw against Myanmar in the last game.India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s participation in the Olympic qualifiers though was marred by seven players pulling out, accusing head coach Maymol Rocky and assistant-coach Chaoba Devi of misbehaviour and favouritism. The seven included Bala Devi. Considered the best player of her generation, Bala Devi scored 26 goals in seven games at this season\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IWL. Kamala Devi, 2017 AIFF Woman Player of the Year, also joined the boycott, as did five other players from Manipur.While the players\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 boycott started over issues with the coach, it continued for the next few months due to what they allege as the absence of a grievance redressal mechanism for women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national team players.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We had called and texted members of the AIFF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s department trying to explain our grievances. All these calls and texts were ignored. Then we wrote a letter to the AIFF explaining why we were pulling out of the national team camp. The federation never responded to or acknowledged our attempts to reach out to them, forget about addressing the issue itself,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d alleged one of the players.Impasse continuesThis month, Bala, only one from the seven players to have received a call-up again, ended her boycott and joined the national team camp.

The 37-year-old seven-time champion is moving into something resembling her best form after an unconvincing first week but will not take Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quarter-final opponent Alison Riske lightly. That would be wise after the 29-year-old American ousted world number one Ashleigh Barty in the last 16.

Having looked so assured in the first week -- and a decent bet to end nearly four decades of Australian being without a women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s singles champion -- she lacked the answers when required as Riske fought back to win 3-6, 6-2, 6-2. There was one consolation for Barty as Pliskova could have taken her number one spot but the Czech third seed went out as well in a marathon duel, beaten by Muchova 4-6, 7-5, 13-11. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is a tough one to swallow but I lost to a better player,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Barty, who had been hoping to become the first Australian champion since Evonne Goolagong Cawley won her second title in 1980. Muchova, meanwhile can call upon star power of Hollywood Rebel Wilson, the actress from Bridesmaids and the Pitch Perfect series of movies. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crazy.

There was a $5 billion U.S. Federal Trade Commission settlement on privacy, and a separate $100 million accord with the Securities and Exchange Commission related to the same issue. The U.S. Department of Justice announced a looming antitrust probe late Tuesday, and then Facebook said Wednesday afternoon that the FTC opened an official investigation into antitrust issues.Many of these inquiries have been brewing for more than a year. But none of it has affected the company\u2019s ability to reel in new users or advertisers. In the second quarter, Facebook topped analysts\u2019 sales estimates and delivered solid user growth. In addressing the company\u2019s results and the fresh FTC scrutiny, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said that he welcomed new rules from regulators, so that he has greater clarity about how to operate the world\u2019s largest social-media company.\u201cIf that doesn\u2019t get put in place, then frustration with the industry will continue to grow,\u201d he said on a conference call.For more than a year, Facebook has been in constant crisis over leaks of users\u2019 data, the spread of violent or false content on its apps, and scrutiny of its power to influence public discourse. That hasn\u2019t deterred advertisers, who have kept spending on Facebook\u2019s sites for the broad reach and precise targeting they offer. While growth at the main Facebook app has slowed, the company is still adding users quickly on other properties, and has embarked on a project to weave its platforms together, creating an even bigger network. A total of 2.7 billion people use at least one Facebook-owned app -- Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp or Messenger -- every month.\u201cDespite horrific headlines for almost two years, usage trends remain strong,\u201d said Benjamin Schachter, an analyst at Macquarie, in a note to investors. As long as the users are still coming, \u201cwe think advertisers will continue to show up.\u201dMenlo Park, California-based Facebook said second-quarter sales rose 28% to $16.9 billion, compared with an average analyst projection of $16.5 billion. In a statement Wednesday, the company said 1.59 billion people log into the main social-media service daily, compared with the 1.57 billion users projected in a Bloomberg survey.\tThe financial results came hours after the announcement of the record-breaking fine from the FTC -- part of a deal that holds Zuckerberg personally accountable for following the new privacy guidelines. Facebook said it set aside $2 billion in the recent period to cover the remainder of that settlement, after allocating $3 billion in the previous quarter.Federal Trade Commission FTC Chairman Joe Simons accompanied by Noah Joshua Phillips speaks during a news conference about Facebook settlement at FTC headquarters in Washington.Both Facebook and the FTC worked to convince the public that the settlement would enact a fundamental shift in how the company operates. Facebook even released a video of Zuckerberg saying as much to employees. But the company will still be able to collect the same kinds of user data and target its promotions in the same way it does today.Shares were little changed in extended trading late Wednesday, after fluctuating up and down following the report. The stock has gained 56% so far this year.While the company\u2019s growth hasn\u2019t been throttled by regulatory changes or privacy restrictions yet, it\u2019s possible new rules could slow future gains. The company said it expects revenue growth to decelerate, especially in the fourth quarter and into 2020.On the call Wednesday, Chief Financial Officer David Wehner gave three reasons for the expected slowdown in sales growth. First, there may yet be more pressure from new global regulations, such as Europe\u2019s new rules governing data collection. Second, there may be changes to privacy rules governed by Apple Inc.\u2019s iOS and Google\u2019s Android mobile operating systems, where Facebook offers its app. Recently, Apple banned one of Facebook\u2019s data-gathering apps. And third, Facebook is making its own privacy tweaks, Wehner said, which could rein in growth. For example, Facebook is expected to release a \u201cClear History\u201d feature later this year, which could hamper ad targeting if Facebook can\u2019t link users\u2019 browsing histories to their profiles.Quarterly results for Facebook, with sales, advertising revenue, daily users and share price Facebook\u2019s user gains by region for the second quarter showed that the main app has almost fully tapped out growth in Europe and the U.S., the company\u2019s most lucrative ad markets. It added the most users in Asia, where it makes an average of only $3.04 per user, compared with $33.27 in the U.S. and Canada.The main social network and its News Feed ads still bring in most of the company\u2019s revenue, but the Instagram photo-sharing app, which has ads in its photo feed and recently added e-commerce tools, is becoming a more significant part of the business. Facebook\u2019s business models for Messenger and WhatsApp, each with more than 1 billion users, are less mature.As the advertising business expands more slowly, Facebook is pushing into new areas, including payments and e-commerce. Zuckerberg said that now that Facebook users are linked to large networks of people and organizations, his next step is to help them find value in those connections. In some ways, Zuckerberg meant \u201cvalue\u201d literally -- through selling items on Facebook Marketplace or while using Instagram\u2019s new shopping tools.The most talked-about and controversial of the company\u2019s new ideas is a plan for a new global cryptocurrency, called Libra, that it hopes will lower the cost of sending money internationally. After its unveiling in June, Libra quickly drew ire from politicians and regulators, and executive David Marcus testified before multiple congressional committees last week in Washington to explain the company\u2019s plans. Facebook is now promising to appease all regulators before launching the cryptocurrency, a process that could take some time.","category":"tech","source":"ht","title":"Facebook\u2019s revenue keeps growing despite regulatory scrutiny"},{"article":"To help users store photos in handsets having less storage and unreliable Internet connection, Google has introduced a lighter alternative to Google Photos called \u201cGallery Go\u201d that weighs just 10MB.The photo gallery app is designed to work offline and automatically organise photos using Machine Learning (ML) and help first time smartphone owners easily find, edit, and manage photos, without the need for Internet or Cloud backup. \u201cGallery Go was designed to help you manage your photos using less data.

It also includes data from highly detailed maps created by Lyft\u2019s test vehicles, which have been gathering data for nearly two years.\u201cOne way to help accelerate innovation in this space is to have broader collaboration not just with industry, but with academia,\u201d Luc Vincent, executive vice president of Lyft\u2019s autonomous driving unit, said in an interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t care about doing everything in secrecy; we care about accelerating the whole industry.\u201dEliminating the human driver from a cab will cut costs by as much as 60%, raising the prospect of lower fares and fatter profits.

Now tech and auto executives are saying they may have overestimated the arrival of the autonomous age and promise to focus on safety before turning the wheel over to robots.Lyft contends that by releasing its driverless data, it can help push the creators of the technology to come up with solutions that solve the remaining challenges. \u201cIt\u2019s quite possible that through this data we will accelerate another player that will eventually create something great,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cThen hopefully we will put that on the Lyft platform.\u201d","category":"tech","source":"ht","title":"Lyft makes\u00a0its self-driving research public"},{"article":"Logitech International SA has side-stepped significant effects on its business from trade tensions between the U.S. and China, in part by anticipating potential problems with suppliers, Chief Executive Officer Bracken Darrell said.\u201cWe changed supply chain, we\u2019re increasing prices in the U.S.,\u201d Darrell said Tuesday in an interview.

With its new Rs 199 mobile-only plan, Netflix is looking to tap into India\u2019s 300 million+ data-hungry mobile internet users. India also offers a window of opportunity to Netflix for propelling its growth after a shocking drop in US users since 2011.Netflix\u2019s mobile-only move may be late but it comes at a time when people are heavily consuming OTT content on-the-go. According to a study by techARC-Unomer MegaInsight study, around 79% of smartphone users access over-the-top (OTT) mobile applications for entertainment in India. Hotstar which leads the OTT segment in India recently broke its own record of live match streaming with 25.3 million concurrent viewers during the India-New Zealand Cricket World Cup semi-finals.Even global players like Google and Facebook have been optimising its services for India through lite apps, offline browsing and more. Netflix also shared insights on how its maximum subscribers come from mobile users.\u201cOur members in India watch more on their mobiles than members anywhere else in the world,\u201d Ajay Arora, Director, Product Innovation of Netflix said.\tPrice warNetflix is not the only international player aggressively pricing its services. Spotify and YouTube Music offers its services starting at Rs 119 and Rs 99 per month respectively. With its new mobile plan, Netflix\u2019s base subscription plan is also now cheaper than Hotstar\u2019s which starts at Rs 299 per month.\u201cNetflix\u2019s limited offerings were overpriced for India, and uncompetitive compared to Amazon Prime and Hotstar\u2019s Rs 999 annual plans. Even though subscribers would squeeze out value by sharing accounts among friends and family, monthly subscriptions at 450 to 650 clearly missed out the much larger mobile-only audience,\u201d said tech policy and media consultant Prasanto K Roy. \u201cThe 350-million-plus smartphone\/broadband users make up an audience that is ten times the wireline-broadband\/big-screen audience in India. There will still be account sharing across devices and people, but with the Rs 199 SD mobile\/tablet plan, Netflix expands its addressable market manifold. This was the obvious way to go and I\u2019m surprised they took so long to do it,\u201d he added.Although a pocket friendly subscription plan, is it enough for Netflix to break ground in India\u2019s price-sensitive market? Netflix will have to offer more plans that meet with the consumption trends of Indian consumers.\u201cSo far, whatever success Netflix has gained is backed by operator support which cannot be sustained beyond a point. They will have to offer plans fitting Indian pockets. So, this is not only about getting new subscribers, it\u2019s also about converting existing users to subscribers who start paying incrementally,\u201d said Faisal Kawoosa, Founder & Chief Analyst, techARC.","category":"tech","source":"ht","title":"Breaking down Netflix\u2019s cheaper mobile-only plan for India"},{"article":"Huawei Technologies Co Ltd\u2019s revenue grew roughly 30% in the first half after select teams secured critical supplies to keep production going despite U.S. technology export restrictions, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.The United States has put Huawei on an export blacklist citing national security issues, barring U.S. suppliers from selling to the world\u2019s largest telecommunications equipment maker and No.2 maker of smartphones, without special approval.Huawei\u2019s revenue growth of 30% in the first half is a slowdown from 39% in first three months of 2019, but is up sharply from 2018, Bloomberg said.

The Wall Street Journal reported the SEC settlement earlier.The Post also reported the FTC also plans to allege Facebook provided insufficient information to about 30 million users about a facial recognition tool, an issue identified earlier by Consumer Reports.The settlement comes amid growing concern among U.S. policymakers about the privacy of online users and have sparked calls for new legal protections in Congress. Separately, the U.S. Justice Department said late Tuesday it is launching a broad antitrust probe into the competitive practices of large tech companies like Facebook.Two people briefed on the matter confirmed the Post report the FTC will not require Facebook to admit guilt as part of the settlement. The settlement will need to be approved by a federal judge and will contain other significant allegations of privacy lapses, the people said.The fine will mark the largest civil penalty ever paid to the FTC.The FTC and Facebook declined to comment.The FTC confirmed in March 2018 it had opened an investigation into allegations Facebook inappropriately shared information belonging to 87 million users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The probe has focused on whether the data sharing violated a 2011 consent agreement between Facebook and the regulator and then widened to include other privacy allegations.A person briefed on the matter said the phone number, facial recognition and two-factor authentication issues were not part of the initial Cambridge Analytica probe.Some in Congress have criticized the reported $5 billion penalty, noting Facebook in 2018 had $55.8 billion in revenue and $22.1 billion in net income. Senator Marsha Blackburn, a Republican, said last week the fine should be $50 billion.While the deal resolves a major regulatory headache for Facebook, the Silicon Valley firm still faces further potential antitrust probes as the FTC and Justice Department undertake a wide-ranging review of competition among the biggest U.S. tech companies. Facebook is also facing public criticism from President Donald Trump and others about its planned cryptocurrency Libra over concerns about privacy and money laundering.The Cambridge Analytica missteps, as well as anger over hate speech and misinformation on its platform, have prompted calls from people ranging from presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren to a Facebook co-founder, Chris Hughes, for the government to force the social media giant to sell Instagram, which it bought in 2012, and WhatsApp, purchased in 2014.But the company\u2019s core business has proven resilient, as Facebook blew past earnings estimates in the past two quarters.

According to the current tax laws, if your \u2018taxable\u2019 salary is Rs 2.5 lakh or lesser, you don\u2019t have to pay any taxes; and if your taxable salary is Rs 5 lakh, your tax liability will become Rs12,500 and you can earn full rebate on that amount. In the interim budget, the then finance minister had increased the rebate amount from the erstwhile Rs 2,500. However, you should note that this is not an exemption and you will still have to file your returns. The tax slab on income above Rs 2.5 lakh continues for those who earn above Rs 5 lakh. For instance, if your taxable income is Rs 6.5 lakh, you still have to pay tax on the Rs 2.5 lakh and Rs 5 lakh slab of 5%. However, you can avoid paying tax in case you invest your money in certain investment instruments. Say your taxable salary is Rs 8.5 lakh and the total tax payable on it is Rs 85,800 including 4% cess. If you bring your taxable income below Rs 5 lakh from Rs 8.5 lakh, you can avoid paying tax. Here is how: If you invest in areas which are allowed for tax deduction, you can reduce your taxable income to Rs 5 lakh. \u201cThe deductions allowed are as follows under various sections. Section 80C - up to Rs 1.5 lakh ( PF, PPF, life insurance premium, tuition fee for two children, principal repayment of home loan, Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana, Tax saver FD), Section 80D \u2013 up to Rs 25,000 towards health insurance premium paid for family, Section 80D \u2013 up to Rs 25,000 towards health insurance premium paid for parents (This is Rs 50,000 if parents are above 60 years), section 80CCD (1B) - up to Rs 50,000 invested in NPS and Section 24 \u2013 up to Rs 2 lakh for the interest paid on home loan,\u201d said Melvin Joseph, founder of Navi Mumabi-based FinVin Financial Planners. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.defineSlot('\/1055314\/HT_Desk_In-story_Top_728x90', [[728, 90],[1, 1]], 'div-gpt-ad-1536739653096-0').addService(googletag.pubads()).setCollapseEmptyDiv(true,true); googletag.pubads().enableSingleRequest(); googletag.enableServices(); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1536739653096-0'); }); If you do not find these above sections relevant, you can further claim tax deductions in other sections. \u201cYou can claim house rent allowance (HRA), however, the deduction for HRA cannot exceed: 50% of your basic salary for metro cities and 40% for non-metro cities, provided your monthly rent amount is 10% more than your basic salary; leave travel allowance but this is allowed twice in a block of four years for self and family members for amount spent on fare,\u201d said Ashok Shah, partner, NA Shah Associates LLP. You can invest in these areas to reduce your taxable income to Rs 5 lakh. \u201cIf you can show Rs 3.5 lakh in total under these heads, your taxable income will be Rs 5 lakh and tax liability will be Rs 12,500.

Yet the brewer should take at least someresponsibility. This concoction was far too frothy for investors when Asian economies face an array of sobering realities.AB InBevsaidit will no longer proceedwith theIPO of its Asia-Pacific business, Budweiser Brewing Company APAC Ltd., which had been aiming to raise as much as $9.8 billion in Hong Kong. The company\u2019s American depositary receipts fell as much as 4.9% in New York before closing down 3% on Friday.The offeringvalued Budweiser Brewing between 15.5 times and 18.2 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization \u2013well above the multiples for Carlsberg A\/S and Heineken NV, and a premium to shares of the parent. The price range of HK$40 to HK$47 ($5.11to $6.01) a share would have resulted in a market capitalization of $54.2 billion to $63.7 billion.You can hardly blame investors for wanting to sit this one out. The U.S.-China trade war is at an impasseand the ripples are widening.Singapore, a bellwether for global trade, on Friday posted its sharpest growth declinesince 2012. While the Federal Reservehas signaledthat interest rate cuts are coming, which has buoyed U.S. stocks, that\u2019s also drivinga wedge between the world\u2019s biggest economy and the rest. This split is perhaps nowhere more apparent than theIPO market. Listings in the U.S. are on track for their best year since 2014. Hong Kong, the top destinationlast year, is languishing by comparison, after a series of high-profile bloopersincluding smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. in July 2018 and food-delivery giant Meituan Dianping in September. As I\u2019ve argued, reclaiming that crown will be an uphill battle; and now Hong Kong is facing competition from Shanghai fortech IPOs. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.\u2019s secondary listingplan is a ray of light \u2013but this latest kerfuffle could dim any optimism.Against this dismal backdrop, it\u2019s little wonder things went south. Yet it\u2019s a mistake to overlook AB InBev\u2019s ownmissteps. For one thing, the company marketed itself as a purveyor of high-end beer, taking cues from Chinese consumers\u2019 growing taste for foreign brands and craft labels. Perhaps its price range doesn\u2019t look so out of whack when you consider the country\u2019s brewers tradeanywhere between 15 times and 21 times, according to Bloomberg data. Yet investors just weren\u2019t convinced that demand would hold up in a slowing economy. The company\u2019s China pitch also ignoredmature markets likeSouth Korea and Australia, whichmake up around half of Budweiser Brewing\u2019s Ebitda, according to Bernstein Research.Then there\u2019s the fact that growing a brandin Asia\u2019s fragmented market is easier said than done. India, where whiskey is the traditional tipple of choice, and Southeast Asia could have been fertile ground for expansion. One argument for an Asia IPOwas thatBudweiser Brewing would benefit from local tie-ups. WouldtheThai tycoon who ownsVietnam\u2019s top brewer, Sabeco Trading Corp.,or the magnate that controls the Philippines\u2019 San Miguel Corp.really cede control to the Belgian brewer for a piece of the Hong Kong listing? I\u2019m unconvinced. The fatal flaw, however,may have been AB InBev\u2019s hubris. In deciding against a cornerstone investor tranche, the company eschewed a fixture of Hong Kong\u2019s IPO market. It turns out investors really do like the comfort of big names that pledge to hold stock \u2013even if the practice ties up a lot of liquidity. Had Budweiser\u2019s listing succeeded, it would have been a win for market reform, too.With such a bubblyvaluation, AB InBev may have thought its investors were wearing beer goggles.

Raveena made her debut with Patthar Ke Phool in 1991 and later worked with him on the cult comedy Andaz Apna Apna. Talking to Mid Day, Raveena said, \u201cHe told everyone that he knows me since the last 120 years. There\u2019s a comfort factor with him. We spoke non-stop on the set, but when the episode was telecast, I realised that they had edited out a major chunk due to time constraints.

Phase Four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) will include 10 movies and Disney+ series when it launches next year.Among the movies announced were the long awaited Black Widow solo movie, a fourth instalment in the Thor series, second film in Doctor Strange series and more. While these are characters that we have already met in the previous 23 films from the MCU, there were quite a few new names taken. Among those were the Eternals, Blade and Shang-Chi and even, a female Thor!So if you have been wanting a small introduction to these new superheroes, we have got you covered:Eternals. Salma Hayek, from left, Lia McHugh, Don Lee and Angelina Jolie participate in the Marvel Studios panel on day three of Comic-Con.The film stars Angelina Jolie as Thena, Salma Hayek as Ajax, along with Game Of Thrones fame Richard Madden as Ikarus, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry, Lia McHugh, and Don Lee. Chloe Zhao is directing the film. In the comics, Eternals are shown as physically similar to normal human beings but with powerful abilities. They have super strength, flight, teleportation, mind control, shape-shifting and energy projection. They were created from alien experiments on ancient humans millions of years ago. They lived in space cities and defended Earth from threats, like the Deviants, another race of super-humans that was more destructive and deformed.There are a few dozen Eternals in the comics, but the movie is said to focus on two of the most prominent ones named Sersi and Ikaris.Shang-ChiDestin Daniel Cretton, left, and Simu Liu speaks during the Shang-Chi and The Legend of the Ten Rings portion of the Marvel Studios panel on day three of Comic-Con. Thor: Love and Thunder is slated for November 5, 2021, release. Natalie Portman will reprise her role as Jane Foster. She will become the first female Thor in the MCU. Taika Waititi will direct the movie. During one of Thor comic\u2019s many storylines, Nick Fury says something to Thor that makes him lose his worthiness to lift the Mjolnir. Later, a woman lifts the hammer, proving her worthiness and fighting against the evil. While Thor tries hard to learn of her identity and win back his hammer at first, he later gives up the fight. He also relinquishes the name and role of Thor and is henceforth simply called Odinson. Meanwhile, Jane is suffering from cancer in real life so Thor doesn\u2019t doubt that she could be the female Thor. However, turning into Thor is the only time when the cancer and chemotherapy have no effect on her.","category":"entertainment","source":"ht","title":"Wondering who are Eternals, Blade, Shang-Chi and other superheroes from MCU?Phase 4 movies?

Possibly in the best phase of his career, the actor wants to thank people, including the media, for \u201ccriticising me to a point that it brought the best out of me\u201d. With films such as Mission Mangal, Housefull 4, Good News, Sooryavanshi and Laxmmi Bomb releasing one after the other, he explains why he isn\u2019t restricting himself to any one genre and wants \u201cto have all kinds of films in my kitty\u201d. In an interview, Akshay shares what his experience taught him, his take on female co-stars, his films releasing globally and why he hasn\u2019t done a Hollywood film, yet.Akshay Kumar, Vidya Balan, Taapsee Pannu, Sonakshi Sinha, Nithya Menen and Kirti Kulhari during the trailer launch of Mission Mangal in Mumbai, Thursday, July 18. Your films not only inspire but entertain, too. Is that the sole mission as an actor? Most of my films be it Padman (2018), Toilet: Ek Prem Katha (2017) or even (the upcoming) Mission Mangal, they have one more thing \u2014 women\u2019s empowerment. But I\u2019ve to do a Housefull, a Rowdy Rathore and a Good News also. So, it\u2019s not that this [issue-based films] is the only thing I do. Whenever I get a chance and a good script, I\u2019ll do it. I want to have all kinds of films in my kitty.Your upcoming films belong to different genres. Is it exciting to juggle so many different roles? All these things have been taught to me by my own experience. I\u2019ve learned that if I do different genres, I won\u2019t be tagged. When I used to do a lot of action, everyone said, \u2018He is an action hero and nothing else\u2019. So, I tried comedy, and then everyone was talking about just that. Then I decided I\u2019ve to do different kinds of films. So, I am thankful to people, and the media, for criticising me to that point and bringing out the best in me.In terms of female co-stars, you\u2019ve worked with leading heroines as well as fresh faces. How do you strike that balance? It doesn\u2019t really matter because what\u2019s important is that the person has to suit the role. It\u2019s not about how big the actor is. And not just female co-stars, it applies to the male actors, too. A lot of times I\u2019ve lost roles. Though I thought I\u2019d be very good (for those roles), the makers felt I won\u2019t be able to perform. When I signed Toilet..., I was told I wouldn\u2019t be able to carry it off. But I took it as a challenge and said, \u2018let me try\u2019. Also, there were times when I myself didn\u2019t feel I fit the part, and backed off. Does that give a sense of contentment? It\u2019s great to see our films being accepted globally. I hope doors are opened in all countries. There are many brilliant films that should go all over the world. I personally feel what Indian cinema is doing, and the kind of scripts it\u2019s bringing on to the screen, even Hollywood is not doing such kind of work.Why haven\u2019t we seen you take up a Hollywood film yet? I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019ve not been offered Hollywood films, but whatever came wasn\u2019t big enough or that great. And I\u2019m very happy doing films here [in Bollywood]. If something very good and effective comes that lets me show my talent in a better way, I would love to do it.Does your family, especially your wife Twinkle Khanna, play a crucial role in your choice of films? Yes, my wife has been a very big help in my career. It\u2019s not that I have to discuss every script with her before I give it my nod, but she talks to me and I remember [those] things. She told me once, \u2018Koi zor zabardasti nahi hai, jo achha lage karo\u2019.","category":"entertainment","source":"ht","title":"Akshay Kumar: \u2018Most of my films have women\u2019s empowerment, but I\u2019ve to do a Housefull, a Rowdy Rathore also\u2019"},{"article":"Actor Arjun Rampal has shared a new picture with his newborn son in his Instagram stories, from the day he was born.

I like how someone can use it to spread awareness on issues,\u201d he says.But, at the same time, he agrees that social media has increased anxieties among people, and also let to an increase in fake news. \u201cEverything that man invents can be used for good or for bad. We split the atom to generate energy and we made a bomb out of it. Similarly, we created social media so we can stay in touch and now we spread both real and fake news through it. Anxiety can come from many sources, social media can definitely add to that, but then an individual inflicted with that disease will find reasons to be anxious with anything until they seek help.\u201d When asked about what are the issues he feels passionately about, he says, \u201cI am more interested in discovering individuals who have innovative environmental solutions, and artistes who are looking to break into the mainstream. I have looked for and discovered fresh talent right from the beginning of my film career, and I plan to continue looking for and giving a break to fresh talent through social media.\u201d Abhay who has received accolades and critical acclaim for a lot of his films, signs off by saying, \u201cI barely watch movies.

I was sleeping on the platform, I had no money,\u201d says Anupam Kher who is all set to release his autobiography next month. The veteran actor hopes that his autobiography, like the one by his idol (Charlie Chaplin), inspire people to take that leap of faith with conviction to realise their dreams. The title, Lessons Life Taught Me Unknowingly, set to release on August 5, will give readers an insight into his life from the time he was a young boy to today, a veteran movie legend, with almost four decades of experience under his belt. Excerpts from an interviewYou had said in an interview, \u201cThis book is about my failures and not my successes,\u201d which is a very apt way to describe one\u2019s autobiography... I had written a book before, The Best Thing about You Is You. It was more of a life coaching book. This one is an autobiography. But this is not about a life of an actor. This is an autobiography of a person who has lived life and has learnt lots of things. It is about the journey of a small town clerk\u2019s son and the lessons life taught him. I remember when the publishing house approached me. Back then, I was going through a rough phase in my life. I was suffering from facial paralysis and I had almost gone bankrupt. The catch is that the world does not perceive you that way, it does not see that. The world feels everyone who is talked about and written about is successful. At that time, I said I was not a writer, they said tape it. But when I recorded for around 10-12 hours of voice notes, and listened, I realised that I only talked about what went wrong in my life. And some of them are really funny, when I look back at them. What was the writing process like? I started writing my autobiography at the age of 10. That makes for the opening line of the book, too. When you revisit your life, it gives you very mixed feelings. There is a very good line in my film, Daddy (1989), \u2018yaad karne par, beeta hua sukh bhi dukh hi deta hai\u2019. It is true because you are remembering your childhood, your struggles and it is sweet yet painful. Nostalgia is painful. There have been times when I am in New York, and I smell something on the streets and I remember my childhood. When you are from a poor family, you are driven to do something great in life. I have been performing my life story on stage for so many years, that I noticed there are so many minute intricacies which will look good in a book. So when I started writing, I first got my play translated into English. But that was nothing compared to what I wanted to write. I wanted to describe the smell of the mud of my land, the visuals of the snow clad mountains where I lived, the feel of being a lower middle class and my poor Hindi school. All this cannot happen in a play or a film. But in a book, it can be captured. So, the process involved taping conversations with myself and transcribing it. Then I started giving it a form. But yes, even today, when I read it, it feels like there are so many things that I\u2019ve left out.Then, how do you decide what to incorporate and what to let go? So, three years ago when I decided the title of my book, it gave me new found focus. So, the title told me what to add what to miss. I have always wanted my life to be inspirational. Because when I was a struggling actor, I used to read autobiographies of people to deal with life and the hardships. But my book is more about the way I have conducted life and the way I have not let failures bother me. There are so many people in the world who want to make it, who don\u2019t have godfathers, and all they need is the right attitude. So, I hope my book can become the means for them to gain that confidence. If one watches your interviews, you come across as a very confident artiste. Were you a confident writer as well? I come across as confident and powerful because I speak the truth, no matter how comfortable or uncomfortable it is for me or the other person. My grandfather used to say, \u2018if you are telling the truth, then you don\u2019t have to remember it\u2019. Also, it comes from the fact that I gained a lot of emotional strength because I lived in a joint family. Even though we were poor, I was emotionally secure. But I have to say, as a writer, no, I was not confident. But I know that I was sincere. But I must add that I did not want to hurt anybody either. But if it is the truth, then you may have to ruffle a few feathers\u2026 No, my truth cannot hurt anybody. I will have to camouflage it. In fact, I have done that with my play, too. I have made sure that it is not at the expense of anybody\u2019s pain.Another person one can think of, who is not afraid to speak the truth is your good friend, actor Robert DeNiro. Will he read the book? Yes, I am going to give him the first copy. I will be in New York, USA, when the book comes out. In fact, he has the manuscript of my earlier book too. Before the book was published, I had given him the manuscript of the Best Thing About You Is You. This was when we were shooting in Philadelphia for Silver Linings Playbook (2012). So, that is also mentioned in the book.","category":"entertainment","source":"ht","title":"\u2018I\u2019ll send Robert De Niro one of the first copies of my autobiography\u2019"},{"article":"Actor Shah Rukh Khan is living his best life holidaying in Maldives with his family.

With a clear 70s gangsta vibe, the photo misses out on two fan favourites though \u2013 Scared Games season 1\u2019s Kuckoo (Kubbra Sait), Anjali Mathur (Radhika Apte) and Constable Katekar (Jitendra Joshi). In a proof that the cops and gangsters of Scared Games clean up nice, the entire cast left their gritty on-screen personas for edgy and ultra-glam avatars. The looks were styled by Tanya Ghavri and Mohit Rai. Says Ghavri, \u201cWe handpicked pieces from various designers, high-street labels, and the actors\u2019 personal vintage collections, and the final ensembles channeled the decade\u2019s anti-conformist, chic approach to fashion.\u201d The shoot was captured by Rohan Shreshtha.Talking about the upcoming show, Saif Ali Khan \u2013 Sacred Games\u2019 Sartaj Singh \u2013 said, \u201cSacred Games Season 2 has been a very creative experience with some bright people putting their best foot forward, being as intelligent as they can, being as artistic as they can, and that\u2019s not an environment that you find every day. It pretty much picks up from where the season 1 ends. While season 1 set the stage, this season develops it further, and deals more with the inner workings of Sartaj\u2019s mind, personality, background, family, and father. It\u2019s a logical progression; there\u2019s a little more action, there\u2019s a little more speed and drama, and it\u2019s also when the whole sacred angle comes in.\u201d Ganesh Gaitonde aka Nawazuddin Siddiqui also spoke about what the audience can expect in the upcoming season, \u201cIn the first season, the challenge was dealing with the situations that I faced as an actor, because I wasn\u2019t aware of what my journey would be like in the second season. The situations my character faces in both seasons are different, so we had to keep adapting accordingly. Of course, we try to put our best foot forward always. In this season, the way Ganesh Gaitonde talks and walks will remain the same, but the change in his surroundings will bring about an internal change in him.\u201d Pankaj Tripathi\u2019s Guruji is expected to play a big role in the new season. Talking about how he will be a game-changer, the actor said, \u201cGuruji is a well-read man, he has his own style of thinking, and much like many others, he too feels that his beliefs and thoughts are superior to others, and that his approach to life is the correct one.\u201d Kalki Koechlin, who enters the show as Batya in season 2, was seen with Guruji in Sacred Games 2 trailer. \u201cBatya is from a very conflicting background; her father is Jewish French and her mother is Palestinian, who had abandoned her as a teenager. You will see Batya\u2019s journey of transforming from a rebellious, angry teenager with a drug addiction to this very calm woman over the years, once she reaches Guruji\u2019s Ashram,\u201d she said. Surveen Chawla, who played Jojo for a fleeting scene in Sacred Games, has a more well defined role in this one. \u201cJojo is somebody who\u2019s not afraid of Gaitonde--she is just amazing. And in season 2, I think you\u2019re going to find out why. She has a tremendous impact on Gaitonde\u2019s life in every way,\u201d Surveen said.Jatin Sarna, who plays the fan favourite Bunty in the show, said, \u201cThe second season will showcase a very different side of Bunty, one which you\u2019ve not seen in season 1. You will have to wait and watch season 2, as there are many exciting things in store for the viewers.\u201d If the motivations of Luke Kenny\u2019s Malcolm intrigued you in season 1, expect the answers this time round. \u201cIn Season 2, we find out a lot more about Malcolm--who he is, where he comes from, and how he is connected to all this. And of course, there\u2019s Guruji who comes into play as well, which is really interesting,\u201d he said.","category":"entertainment","source":"ht","title":"Sacred Games 2 will showcase a new Ganesh Gaitonde and Bunty, reveals cast as they pose 70s gangsta style in bonus photoshoot"},{"article":"He belongs to a rare breed of actors, who aren\u2019t afraid to take risks, and want to be free from the constraints of any \u2018image\u2019. Just when you thought there was nothing more to actor Saif Ali Khan than the suave and stylish characters he played in many films in recent times, he dared to go the web way, when no other major film star was keen on it. And it won\u2019t be wrong to say that Sacred Games in a way resurrected his career and he is all set to reprise the same magic again.Saif, currently in London for the shoot of his next film, takes out some time for a chat with us:You started off with masala films, reinvented yourself with Dil Chahta Hai, and went on to do Omkara, Race, etc. Do you feel you have got your due as an actor?Yes, of course! More than my due. I feel very satisfied, doing the kind of stuff that I enjoy doing. I feel my life is quite well-balanced, between working and spending time with my family, and experiencing life as it rushes by. I\u2019m certainly not, in any way, grumpy about the situation. I think people have been kind and patient, watching me and accepting what I do. Normally, if I\u2019m good, I get reviewed well, and if I\u2019m not paying attention, I get reviewed badly. So, it\u2019s pretty straight! It\u2019s not the other way round. If I work hard, that gets noticed, and if I don\u2019t, that gets noticed too.Of late, we\u2019ve seen big films bombing while smaller ones made numbers. How have you adapted to the unpredictability of the business? It\u2019s in the midst of some kind of renaissance, like it was in the 1950s or 60s. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been a better time. And it\u2019s only going to blow up huge from here. Everyone\u2019s kids want to join [Bollywood] now, and that means it\u2019s going to be different types of looks, roles, people. The fixed stereotypes we had in our mind are constantly being broken. The film industry is really going to benefit, and there\u2019s a lot of room for everyone. I\u2019m thrilled it\u2019ll be out of control of the film mafia, where people try and control\u2026 it\u2019s just going to be too big, and become like Hollywood.Your kids, too are following in your footsteps. While Sara is already a star, there\u2019s talk about Ibrahim, who looks exactly like you, also making his debut soon...He should, he\u2019s looking good, better looking than I am! He\u2019s a very charming guy. I definitely think all of my children would be interested in acting. We\u2019re an acting family, the whole bunch of us are in the industry. So I\u2019m sure.

The 32-year-old was crowned the latest global golf star after leaving the field way behind, winning the British Open by six shots at the Royal Portrush Golf Club in Northern Ireland on Sunday.Lowry\u2019s triumph wiped out past frustration, especially a meltdown in the 2016 US Open after going into the final round four shots ahead. It left questions of another nearly man hanging over the affable Lowry, who one report said was the first bearded winner of the year\u2019s final Major in well over a century!Lowry was being hailed as a great champion for the way in which he dealt with the pressure of staying ahead, after going into Sunday\u2019s final round four shots ahead of England\u2019s Tommy Fleetwood. He finished with a one-over 72 in the final round to ensure there would not be a second meltdown, and rather he won\u2019t let any of his great rivals come anywhere near.Links courses are tough to tackle and demand a conservative approach, but Lowry, who learnt his first golf lessons on his own, choose to follow his mantra. \u201cProfessional golf is all about just ticking along and taking your birdies when you can. If you can make four or five birdies a day and try and limit your mistakes you\u2019re going to be up there at the end of the week,\u201d said Lowry.Nothing tests a golfer more than the kind of course on which The Open is played. The links course is fundamentally different from the tree-lined and minutely designed modern courses that dot the calendar on the PGA Tour. And that is why some of the finest golfers of the world struggled as rain and wind made life difficult.To start with, the word \u2018links\u2019 is derived from the Old English word \u2018hlinc\u2019, with Scottish root. It means rising ground with ridges on the coast and is characterised by undulating surface and sand dunes. While the land by the ocean is not suited for cultivation, a sort of fescue grass does grow on it.Typically the links course is quite barren\u2014there is no tree for shelter from wind or rain, both major challenges for the players who need to factor in the shifting weather even during the course of a round, leave alone the tournament. The open course leaves golfers at the mercy of the weather, thus placing a demand on their skills that are way different from playing on designer courses. Apart from finding their tee shots veering off course due to strong winds, the firm fairways due to the hard turf means the golfers can\u2019t attack the green and instead must land the ball short and let it run on to the putting surface. Water hazards too are rare on links courses whose distinct feature is also the deep \u2018pot bunkers\u2019. Due to the wind factor, lower flight of the ball is key while the greens are slower to prevent the ball from moving. The British Open has always been held on a coastal links course in England, Scotland or Northern Ireland. Links golf is considered the purest form of the game where the course is shaped by nature rather than \u2018built\u2019 or designed.","category":"sport","source":"ht","title":"Hard to rule, links courses are closest to golf\u2019s roots"},{"article":"Kieron Pollard and Sunil Narine made a comeback into the West Indies side as selectors named a 14-member squad for the first two T20Is against India on Monday.

That is the lesson they can take from their World Cup experience. For the limited-overs team, the cycle heading into the mega event in England was spent searching for dashing batsmen who could complement the irrepressible top-order. But in the end, India landed at the tournament confused over who to fit where in the middle order. It became a case of musical chairs, and in desperation Dinesh Karthik, originally picked as a back-up \u2019keeper to MS Dhoni, was fielded as a specialist batsman.When your top-order is packed with flamboyant players\u2014Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli who all can take your breath away with stroke play and the ability to single-handedly snatch the game away from the opposition, it\u2019s but natural some other players will suffer in comparison. By the looks of it, that is what seems to have happened with Ajinkya Rahane and Ambati Rayudu\u2019s ODI careers.Also Read: Azharuddin places request to MS Dhoni before announcing retirementAfter 50 ODIs, Rayudu averaged 47 with 10 fifties and three hundreds. After 90 ODIs, Rahane averages 35 with 24 fifties and three hundreds. They had experience, and going by numbers too, they were a safe bet. But expectations were simply too high. The team management appeared to be looking for someone better. Rahane and Rayudu offered solidity but were not in the Kohli-Sharma mould. They won\u2019t intimidate, but will do the job effectively.Ultimately, at the World Cup, KL Rahul batted at No 4 and Rahane looked on helplessly as he played for Hampshire in the County. The batting template adopted by KL Rahul\u2014build-up slowly and anchor the innings\u2014is similar to what we saw Rahane follow, but he was criticised.Rayudu abruptly announced his retirement at 33, after he was ignored even when a second player was injured in the World Cup and the middle-order cried out for reinforcement. Also Read: India tour of West Indies - 3 players who missed out on selection.As the new cycle begins post-World Cup, a fresh set of players are being tried. Among the choices, we again don\u2019t have names that will excite you to the level of Kohli and Sharma. They have picked Shreyas Iyer and Manish Pandey, and both will be wary of expectations. They will be conscious how Kohli and Sharma can make any batsman look ordinary. At the World Cup, a stroke player like Rahul paled in comparison to Sharma.Pandey and Iyer were among the batsmen who were tried out before the World Cup. The former underlined his potential with a superb ton against Australia in Sydney, the lone ODI India won during the five-match series in 2016. Thereafter the Karnataka batsman has been in and out of the team, struggling to match Kohli and Sharma, before the selectors finally discarded project-Pandey after the 2018 Asia Cup. He regained form in the second half of IPL and has consolidated his position with runs for India A, which he is captaining now in the West Indies. The unbeaten hundred in the third unofficial one-dayer proved timely for an India recall.Same is the case with the 24-year-old Iyer. He has played six ODIs and averages a decent 42 with two fifties, and is having a good run on the A tour in the West Indies. Iyer came back into reckoning after an impressive showing in IPL while leading Delhi Capitals.In their earlier stints, the two were left battling insecurities, and if the Indian team is looking at them as long-term prospects, they must be given time to settle down. The two will face stiff competition for a middle-order slot from KL Rahul and Kedar Jadhav. Chief selector MSK Prasad has promised to back them this time. \u201cI am sure you have seen by the way we have selected the team that we are looking ahead.\u201dThe two have been picked in the T20 squad too, with an eye on next year\u2019s T20 World Cup, the next big assignment in world cricket.Former India batsman, coach and selector Anshuman Gaekwad said the selectors and team management must show far-sightedness as far as a player\u2019s potential is concerned and back him through and through. \u201cIn the last two-three years we have tried 13-14 players; this can\u2019t happen. We should be able to judge who is there for the long term. You need them (Rahane) in places like England, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand, where conditions are tough to bat. You need to give the player assurance. It\u2019s not that he has done badly. When you try out so many new faces, you forget the old ones.\u201dGaekwad gave Rahul Dravid\u2019s example. \u201cWhen I was coach, the selectors were convinced Dravid was not a one-day player. It took me a long time to convince them and they relented when two sides had to be picked at the same time in 1998, for the Commonwealth Games and a one-day series in Toronto. Look where Dravid is now? He finished with 10,000 plus runs in ODIs. (In some ways) it is a similar case (with Rahane).\u201cIt was the same with Mohammad Azharuddin. His first game was my last Test and he got three hundreds in a row. After that he continuously kept failing, but the selectors never doubted his ability.\u201dIf Pandey and Iyer are hoping to blaze the turf like top-order men do, then they are also likely to trip up like Rahane and Rayudu.When asked about Rahane after Sunday\u2019s selection meeting, Prasad didn\u2019t have a convincing answer. \u201cHe was there in the scheme of things but we have to reward performances of India \u2018A\u2019. That is why we haven\u2019t included him.\u201dAll eyes are now on Pandey and Iyer. They have the potential to do their job effectively. The Indian team management has to lower its expectations and let them be themselves.","category":"sport","source":"ht","title":"Time to tweak India\u2019s middle game"},{"article":"Haryana Steelers began their campaign in the Pro Kabaddi Season 7 with an emphatic 34-24 win over Puneri Paltan here Monday.

I feel some decision will come. Otherwise, people will keep writing that (he) should retire, not retire. Because, no statement has come from Dhoni.\u201d While many experts believe Dhoni is a spent force, Azharuddin felt he can still continue if he has the drive and a body that is 100 percent fit.\u201cMy opinion is that if he is fit and playing well, he should play. If he is fit and performance is good, he can play. Sometimes what happens is, interest is lost after playing so much cricket. If his interest is still 100 per cent, I feel, he is good player and he should play,\u201d he said.\u201cBut, I just want to request him. Whenever he plays, he should play aggressively. Sometimes, reflexes slow down after certain age. But, Dhoni, it does not appear that the reflexes are slow. If he plays his natural game more, I feel that will be good for India.\u201d Azharuddin said Dhoni would take the right decision whenever it is to be taken.\u201cHe has taken rest for two months. May be, he will tell after that what he will do. I feel he will take the right decision whenever it is to be taken,\u201d he said.Speaking to reporters here, Azharuddin differed with the clarification of selection committee chairman MSK Prasad that Ambati Rayudu could not be picked as one of the replacements during the World Cup, as the team management had made a specific request for an opener.\u201cWhen a person is standing by, I feel the standby person should be picked, if any replacement is needed. \u201cIf you are a selector, you can overrule captain and coach. You can put your foot down and say, \u2018no, we will send this player\u2019. When I was captain, I also wanted some players but the selectors said no. It happens. You are not selected, it is very sad. It happened like that.

For developed countries, the economy has always been the fulcrum of politics. In India, \u201cvoters do not cast their vote, but they vote their caste\u201d is a popular saying. The 2019 elections have introduced a new narrative \u2014 good economics is good politics through social empowerment.Putting the citizen first is the guiding principle of good governance. It is this ideology that brings stakeholders, the government and the citizens closer to each other. Good governance is the key to a country\u2019s prosperity and progress. For this to happen, it is important that the citizens become active participants in governance. Swachh Bharat is a textbook example. The redressal of public grievances assures the citizens that their vote has not gone wasted. Technology is an important tool for good governance as it ensures transparency and accountability which result in the betterment and welfare of all citizens. It also leads to the simplification of processes. The best example is the self-certification of startups introduced by the Narendra Modi government, exhibiting trust in their citizens. Digital India ensures that government services are available to the citizen with little human interference.These features of good governance were the hallmark of the Modi-led National Democratic Alliance-I government. Social empowerment, which came through good economics, is now good politics.Voters choose a stable government with a strong, decisive leadership. Now, development has become the buzzword. With the coming of age of social media, people can make more informed choices in many areas. Understanding this, Modi has mastered the skill of optimising social media as a tool to connect with the people.Your words matter, not numbers, PM tells Opposition Building a global urban narrative For the first time, we are seeing a government that is determined to improve the socioeconomic status of the people. Niti Aayog selected 100 districts and called them Aspirational Districts, focusing on health and nutrition, education, agriculture and water resources, financial inclusion and skill development. These core areas have a direct bearing on the quality of life and the economic productivity of citizens. The prime minister himself, along with the Niti Aayog, monitors the outcomes on a continuous basis with the state governments.In Uttar Pradesh, eight backward districts have been selected as aspirational: Balrampur, Shravasti, Bahraich, Siddharth Nagar, Chandauli, Sonbhadra, Fatehpur and Chitrakoot. They are already showing positive results. Such microplanning has never been seen in Indian political governance. Known popularly as the \u201cModi Development Model\u201d, it was adopted by the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath.

Within a year, the Adityanath government had received proposals worth Rs 4.68 lakh crore. Uttar Pradesh is gradually becoming the favourite stop for investors in India.The new narrative for political parties has become development.

Hindi lovers from all over the world had gathered in Johannesburg. I was presiding over the media session of the 10th World Hindi Conference. Mani Shankar Aiyar was the chief guest. In his speech, Aiyar had said that nothing could be as good as a person from Bihar arriving in a village in Tamil Nadu and people there asking him in Hindi, \u201cBhai kaise ho?\u201d Similarly, if a Tamilian were to go to a village in Bihar and be asked, \u201cNeeng epdi irikel?\u201dThere are two reasons why I still remember those moments- first that I realised that Aiyar was absolutely right in what he was saying. He is from Tamil Nadu though he was born in Lahore. Besides Tamil and Hindi, he is conversant in Punjabi and Urdu. How I wish, other Indians knew one or more Indian language besides their mother tongue. After the session was over, some young people emerged from the crowd and asked me where Mani Shankar Aiyar was. One of them asked why Aiyar felt Hindi speakers should know Tamil. I again asked what their response would be if a Tamil speaker spoke in Hindi. They said it was the duty of every citizen of the country to know Hindi.Languages and dialects are like those relatives whom we accept at our own will and who cannot be imposed on us. In 1937, when the government was formed in Madras Presidency, C Gopalachari made the use of Hindi mandatory in schools. Periyar and many pro-Tamil leaders were vocal in their protest. The movement became violent. The police had to use force in many places and some lives were lost. From then on, Tamil parties have resented Hindi.Our Parliament was also affected. After much debate, the Official Language Resolution was passed in 1968. As per the resolution, Hindi-speaking states had to teach an Indian language besides Hindi and in non-Hindi speaking states, Hindi was to be taught besides English and the local or regional language. This three-language formula was accepted by everyone but Tamil Nadu was adamant.In 1971, when I took admission in the 6th standard, I was given three options for languages. Telugu, Kannada or Bangla? We lived in Tagore town in Allahabad those days where a large number of Bengalis lived. I opted for Bangla and for the next three years I got the opportunity to understand the language. While writing these lines I can say proudly that this also awakened an interest in reading the immortal literature of Bengal. No place for Hindi in Tamil Nadu, says AIADMK .Now we come to the present day. When the Central government saw the resentment increasing it explained that it did not want to impose Hindi on anyone. Politics has always followed the policy of one step forward two steps back as far as languages are concerned. When the Hindi-speakers of our generation were growing up, Lohiya had launched the \u2018angrezi hatao\u2019 (remove English) movement. Many people boycotted English. It felt good to hear that if Soviet Russia, China, France or Germany could progress so much without English, then India too could grow with Hindi? But this only damaged us. Hindi speakers faced difficulties in getting employment and found themselves at a disadvantage on many other fronts because they didn\u2019t know English well. In exactly the same way, Tamil speakers faced more problems than people from Karnataka or unified Andhra Pradesh when they came to Delhi or any other part of the country. We should love our own language, but if we close the doors on other languages, we are shutting out so much knowledge. The census of 2011 is an eye-opener. In the beginning of that decade, the number of Hindi speakers and those who could understand Hindi was over 52 crores. This number increased by 10 crores from 2001 to 2011. The biggest reason for the increase which will continue is that people are now moving on to the emerging metropolitan cities in search of employment opportunities. According to the previous data, the number of people speaking Hindi, Oriya and Assamese in the southern regions has increased by 33%. Clearly, after commercial activities increased in the cities of Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Chennai and Surat, people from the east and north have started coming and settling down in these cities.One aspect which is often forgotten is the contribution of our Bollywood films. Hindi films which are produced in Mumbai, considered to be a Hindi-speaking city have played a significant role in spreading the language all over the country. There was a time when we knew of actors like Rajinikanth, Mohan Lal, Rekha, Hema Malini or Sridevi only through these films. Now with the changing times, the cinema from the south has also been becoming popular. Baahubali was dubbed in Hindi also and it broke all box office records.","category":"politics","source":"ht","title":"Let\u2019s keep language out of politics"},{"article":"One of the senior BJP?leaders of Bihar and state\u2019s health minister, Mangal Pandey played a key role as the party in-charge in its emphatic victory in Jharkhand, where the BJP?won 12 out of the 14 Lok Sabha seats while fighting a united Opposition. Earlier, Pandey had steered the party in the assembly polls to a phenomenal return to power in Himachal Pradesh. In an interview to Subhash Pathak, he says Jharkhand had overcome the era when political parties used to exploit the people\u2019s sentiments in the name of a separate state from Bihar. Excerpts:How could you make the Jharkhand contest almost one-sided?After successive defeats of the BJP in the state\u2019s bypolls, I was given an impression that it was difficult to retain all 12 Lok Sabha seats in Jharkhand. Soon after I was made the in-charge, I started following the action plan stipulated by BJP chief Amit Shah and relied on achievements of the Central and state governments to win over people. Leaders of our coalition partners, including All Jharkhand Students\u2019 Union , Janata Dal United (JDU) and Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) helped us carry the positive message to the masses.Was there any special strategy after the BJP\u2019s debacle in the recent bypolls?After assuming the charge of Jharkhand, I held rounds of meetings with party workers from booth to the state level. My 30 years of experience of working with the party helped me identify issues. My efforts lifted morale of the workers, who finally delivered the good for the party and the nation. The opposition led by the Congress was united and trying to play it up against the state government. Did you expect such a landslide?There was a basic different between 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Contrary to 2014 polls, all opposition parties like Congress, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Jharkhand Vikas Morcha-Prajatantrik (JVM-P) got united and sought to project the alliance like a major force. Sensing their strategy, BJP put all its resources to apprise the masses about the schemes of central and the state governments, ensured they were implemented on time and their benefits reached the last person. People were made to realize that the BJP was the only party that could cater to the present needs of the country.Did Pulwama attack on CMPF convey and Balakot air strike help the BJP override the opposition\u2019s unity?It is for the first time that nationalism grew up as a major political issue, when people began crying for all out war against terror and national security, rising above all caste, social and sectarian lines. A perception was built among the people that the nation is first for one and all. And it worked to mobilize the electors in support of the BJP and the NDA.In the BJP\u2019s wave, political stalwarts of Jharkhand like JMM chief Sibu Soren and JVM-P president Babulal Marandi were swept aside. What does it signify for Jharkhand?JMM founder Shibu Soren should have taken retirement from active politics, as he had crossed the age. And his defeat in his stronghold of Dumka made it amply clear. The way Babulal Marandi faced massive defeat in Koderma, it seems people made him to take voluntary retirement. People of Jharkhand also taught a lesson to Congress. They are unwilling to accept a non-resident Jharkhandi to head the party.","category":"politics","source":"ht","title":"\u2018Shibu Soren should have taken retirement from active politics\u2019"},{"article":"BJP chief Amit Shah on Saturday hailed the Lok Sabha election results as a testimony of people choosing politics of performance over politics of \u2018dynasty, casteism and appeasement\u2019. \u201cAfter the sixties, democracy in this country was under the grip of dynasty politics, casteism and appeasement.

Indian elections are best understood by taking a state-wise approach, given the linguistic and other socio-economic diversities in our country. And, politics needs to be seen as a continuous process between the 2014 and the 2019 general elections, rather than assuming that there has been a five-year vacuum between the two. We believe that a careful analysis of these two factors can allow us to put the 2019 results in a macro-yet-disaggregated perspective. Along with this, we have also tried to use the elections to explore some larger political economy ideas that have an important role in shaping the political processes of our country. Here\u2019s a recap of some of our important stories that we have done as part of our national election coverage.The Election Commission of India (ECI) announced the schedule for 2019 general elections on March 10. In their first data story (https:\/\/bit.ly\/30BtwRo) after the polls were officially announced, we gave a snapshot of how decimating the Congress in direct contest states and forging a multi-class, multi-caste collation helped the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secure a majority of its own in the Lok Sabha in 2014. The story also looked at parliamentary constituency (PC) wise extrapolated results from assembly elections held between 2014 and 2019. Another story on March 19 underlined the importance of states vis-\u00e0-vis the first-past-the-post system, where regional parties in bigger states such as West Bengal and Tamil Nadu end up getting a relatively higher seat share for a given vote share compared to national parties. The story also pointed out the importance of nine states \u2013 Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Maharashtra and Gujarat \u2013 in the seat tally of the BJP in the country. Read More| An app to track real-time trends on counting dayWe also looked at political data in each specific state to explain the importance of various factors including alliance arithmetic in shaping the 2019 results. Some of our work underlined the importance of looking differently even within a state, such as a May 2 story that explained the relatively higher vulnerability of the BJP in Uttar Pradesh vis-\u00e0-vis the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Samajwadi Party (SP) alliance.An April 3 story on Karnataka tried to explain how the impressive headline vote share numbers of the Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular) alliance in Karnataka might not lead to a rout of the BJP in the state. Voter turnouts are the only authentic data that is available for analysis when the election process in on. In his April 28 story, Kawoosa pointed out the Kashmir valley was headed for lowest voter turnout in two decades. The final numbers, a turnout of 18.9% in the three PCs in the Kashmir valley have confirmed the argument. Another story on May 8 pondered on whether the relatively higher increase in voter turnout in the states of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan pointed towards a restoration of political competition in the state unlike 2014, when a section of anti-BJP voters might not have come out to vote expecting imminent defeat.The 2019 election is the first in which the EC has decided to introduce candidate pictures along with their electoral symbols on the electronic voting machines. In this March 18 story Kawoosa scraped ECI data to show the extent of problems caused by namesake candidates in elections. Elections in India also generate a lot of focus on the importance of caste in the country. This March 27 story cautioned readers about relying too much on headline caste demographic numbers even at the state level. Another April 4 story tried to explain the complicated relationship between caste and class in Indian politics by highlighting how economic fortunes of similar broad caste groups vary significantly across states and how Other Backward Classes (OBCs) thanks to their large share in population have a significantly large share among the richer sections of the society.Also Read| Nitish Kumar says summer not appropriate for polls, calls for fewer phasesApart from this author, Abhishek Jha and Vijdan Mohammad Kawoosa, HT\u2019s data coverage was complemented by columnists such as Neelanjan Sircar, a senior visiting fellow at Centre for Policy Research and an assistant professor at Ashoka University, Gilles Verniers, co-director of the Trivedi Centre for Political Data at Ashoka University, and Milan Vaishanav, Director of South Asia Programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace at Washington DC.","category":"politics","source":"ht","title":"Lok Sabha elections 2019: Crunching numbers to make sense of politics"},{"article":"DMK president MK Stalin on Tuesday rubbished the claims of Tamil Nadu BJP president Tamilisai Soundarrajan who claimed that the Dravidian major was in talks with the saffron party and said he would quit politics if proved otherwise.\u201cIf Tamilisai Soundarrajan or Narendra Modi, whom she wants to become Prime Minister again prove that I am talking to them for an alliance with the BJP, I\u2019m prepared to quit politics.

So I got up late. I really don\u2019t know what has happened there.\u201d The journalists received this reply from Bengali actress Moon Moon Sen when she was asked what caused the electoral violence in her parliamentary constituency, Asansol. That day, there was another surprising scene on TV. This time it was Sunny Deol. As soon as he stepped out of the polling booth after casting his vote, journalists questioned him about his new political avatar. He first folded his hands and then ran towards his car without saying anything. In my experience of 40 years as a journalist, I have seen many good and bad events, but never before have I witnessed such scenes.Let\u2019s first look at Moon Moon Sen. In 2014, Babul Supriyo was elected from Asansol. He is a Union minister of state and a well-known singer. Perhaps Mamata Banerjee thought that Moon Moon Sen is more popular than Babul Supriyo and so she will definitely be able to defeat him. Sunny Deol has also been given ticket from Gurdaspur solely on this basis. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) high command may have thought that if Dharmendra in 2009 and Hema Malini in 2014 can win on the basis of sheer glamour from regions they are not directly identified with, then why not Sunny Deol? Moreover, he has replaced Vinod Khanna, so this would be a seamless transition.It was perhaps on this basis that the actress of yesteryears, Urmila Matondkar, was selected as a candidate. Matondkar has no political experience but now she is a Congress Lok Sabha candidate from North Mumbai.This practice of film stars joining politics started in south India way back in the 1960s. After about two decades, the trend caught up in the north too. I remember, in the initial phase, actors had to face a lot many problems. In 1984, Amitabh Bachchan was contesting against Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna in Allahabad. At that time, many who considered Allahabad the country\u2019s intellectual capital were quite displeased with the fact that though it was not unconstitutional to field an actor against such a famous and prominent leader, it was certainly improper. Noted poet and Amitabh\u2019s father, Harivansh Rai Bachchan, himself had to camp in Allahabad to placate these people. Lok Sabha elections 2019: Shetty vs Matondkar contest in Mumbai North delivers the highest turnout It is not a coincidence that almost all the political parties have a preference for film stars and sports figures. These parties work and function through their workers. Many senior leaders of various parties have worked relentlessly and selflessly for their parties. Then, it is puzzling that they are neglecting their own party workers.To what extent can the people who get tickets to contest elections without even being familiar with the party\u2019s principles prove to be the well-wishers of the party? Take, for example, Sapna Choudhary. At first, she was rumoured to have joined the Congress but the very next day she was seen singing the praises of the BJP.Unfortunately, Indian politics is either driven by dynasties or fairweather entrants. Haven\u2019t we been degenerating step by step in every election because of this?I am reminded of a scene from the film Anari. In it, Raj Kapoor finds the wallet which belongs to Motilal, who had dropped it. As Raj Kapoor approaches Motilal to return the wallet, some goons attack him. Thrashed and with his clothes torn, he somehow manages to reach the club where Motilal is and returns the wallet. Motilal looks at him with surprise and says something which has always stayed with me. \u201cYoung man, all these people you see around here must have got some wallets, which were dropped at one point or another, which they did not return.\u201dIndian politics is also turning into a club for the elite. Those who came to the corridors of power by struggling in the name of democracy are either too ambitious and later doomed to become like those very people they had protested against. That\u2019s why our democracy has now been reduced to a mere chariot for some families, corporates and the glamour brigade. The voters may nurture the illusion of driving this chariot if they want to, but the fact is what they consider the power to elect is not in their hands at all. Is this democracy or a mere mirage?","category":"politics","source":"ht","title":"The gradual degeneration of Indian politics"},{"article":"In a counter-attack, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Sunday accused former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of leaving behind an economy in slowdown, after Singh\u2019s criticism that the Indian economy is in \u201cdire straits\u201d under PM Modi and also predicted that it is headed for a slowdown.In a series of tweets, Jaitley pointed out that it was Manmohan Singh who left behind an economy in slowdown in 2014.

Microsoft does not provide an absolute revenue figure for Azure, blending it into its \u201cintelligent cloud unit,\u201d which had revenue of $11.4 billion compared with analyst expectations of $11.0 billion, according to Refinitiv data.Microsoft also forecasted between $10.3 billion and $10.5 billion in intelligent cloud sales for the fiscal first quarter, with a midpoint above analyst estimates of $10.13 billion. The forecast helped send shares of Microsoft up more than 2.6% to record highs above $140 in after-hours trading.Cloud growth powered Microsoft\u2019s market value past $1 trillion for the first time in April. On Thursday, Microsoft\u2019s Azure-based business segment for the first time ever reported slightly more quarterly revenue than its Windows-based segment.\u201cThe pressure was obviously on but they executed,\u201d said Hal Eddins, chief economist for Microsoft shareholder Capital Investment Counsel. \u201cThe cloud is such a key driver of growth for them and they seem to have painted a big bullseye on the back of AWS.\u201dIn the cloud computing business, Azure\u2019s chief rival is Amazon Web Services, which dominates the industry with a 32.8% market share, according to research firm Canalys. Microsoft has a share of 14.6%, while Google has 9.9%.Microsoft has also gained ground in the past year by bundling its Azure computing service for developers along with Office and other software products for end users, such as in the more than $2 billion cloud deal it signed with AT&T Inc earlier this week.Microsoft has tried to set itself apart from AWS by combining its traditional software that runs in a customer\u2019s own data centre with its Azure products, a strategy that Chris Voce, analyst at Forrester, said helped power the company\u2019s results.Revenue in Microsoft\u2019s productivity software unit jumped 14.3% to $11.05 billion, driven by double-digit revenue growth for LinkedIn and Office 365. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $10.71 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\u201cIts hybrid cloud strategy has resonated with enterprises where this is a more realistic and flexible approach,\u201d Voce said.Meanwhile, its personal computing division, home to Windows software, rose to $11.3 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $10.98 billion. The unit also includes Xbox gaming consoles, the Bing online search service and Surface laptops.Mike Spencer, head of investor relations at Microsoft, said Windows results were fuelled by customers upgrading from Windows 7, which will be retired next year, and the result of some PC customers stockpiling inventory in anticipation of possible tariffs.\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is there was even maybe more pent-up demand than we anticipated,\u201d Spencer said. He said the company did not feel any impact from sales restrictions placed on Huawei Technologies Co Ltd by the U.S. government.","category":"tech","source":"ht","title":"Microsoft\u2019s growing cloud sales help push shares to record highs"},{"article":"Xiaomi\u2019s Redmi is working on a new smartphone with 64-megapixel rear camera.

Even those who bought VR headsets -- either as an independent unit or bundled with smartphones -- have dumped those at home.According to the International Data Corporation (IDC), the global Augmented Reality (AR) and VR headset market returned to growth after a full year of decline in the first quarter this year, as global shipments reached 1.3 million -- up 27.2 per cent -- from the same quarter last year.VR headsets represented 96.6 per cent of the combined AR\/VR market during the quarter with strong volumes from top companies such as Sony, Facebook, HTC, Pico and 3Glasses.There is no doubt that enterprise AR is evolving quickly, especially in the fields of healthcare, education and at firms that aim to enhance customer experiences.\u201cMany companies are actively looking for hardware solutions they can use to improve existing business processes and drive new ones,\u201d says Tom Mainelli, Group Vice President, Consumer and Devices Research, at IDC.However, VR headsets have failed to strike a chord with the consumers.\u201cOne of the main reasons why VR is not booming into the consumer segment is because of the uncomfortable, clunky headsets -- even early VR adopters have complained of mental fatigue due to prolonged use of VR headsets,\u201d Prabhu Ram, Head - Industry Intelligence Group (IIG), CMR, told IANS.\u201cSecondly, there is a clear dearth of quality VR content that one could watch,\u201d he added.According to Delhi-based tech entrepreneur Tanuj Malhotra, who is working on his own VR startup called VRover, the technology is not going to come to life anytime soon.Reports suggest that even as a relatively young technology, AR has shown more promise than VR as it involves adding visual elements to the real world -- typically via smartphones. Unlike VR, it does not push users into distinct virtual environments.\u201cIt is impossible for VR to take off and compete with AR unless vendors make some serious changes from the consumers\u2019 perspective,\u201d said Malhotra.\u201cVR content out there is not readily available to consumers. Also, the VR technology is not able to rule out nausea and other health-related issues while experiencing it,\u201d he added.According to Jack McCauley, one of the co-founders of Oculus, Facebook-acquired VR firm Oculus may not be profitable as the social networking giant is struggling to bring VR to the mainstream consumer market.","category":"tech","source":"ht","title":"Years later, Virtual Reality headsets are yet to take off"},{"article":"South Korea\u2019s largest auto parts maker Hyundai Mobis on Sunday said it has developed a camera monitoring system that will replace side-view mirrors in next-generation vehicles.With the advanced sensor technology, Hyundai Mobis has joined a couple of global future mobility developers and it aims to export the technology to carmakers, Yonhap news agency reported.Three high-performance camera sensors inside the vehicle will not only increase driving safety by significantly reducing blind spots, and but also improve fuel efficiency as side-view mirrors will be hidden inside the car, Hyundai Mobis said in a statement.\u201cThe paradigm shift to the future car is demanding both functional and design upgrades of all core components, which have been taken for granted until today,\u201d Vice President Gregory Baratoff in charge of autonomous vehicle development at Hyundai Mobis said in the statement.The company will not only develop element technologies, like sensors and solutions based on them, but also the core parts portfolio that it has already secured in accordance with the future car era, he said","category":"tech","source":"ht","title":"Hyundai Mobis\u2019s new camera system could replace vehicle side mirrors"},{"article":"After the International Business Machines Corp.

But it does exist for sure in India. I think we have an opportunity to scale much more quickly,\u201d John Allessio, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Global Services, Red Hat Inc, told IANS in a freewheeling chat here.The acquisition by Big Blue won\u2019t change Red Hat\u2019s \u201cmission\u201d, nor will it curtail its contribution to the open source community, Allessio stressed.Raleigh, North Carolina-headquartered Red Hat reported $3.4 billion in revenue in the 2019 financial year -- up 15 per cent year-on-year.\u201cRed Hat has experienced 69 quarters of continuous growth which means every quarter you are hiring people across the word and that is going to continue for sure,\u201d Allessio said. \u201cAfter the acquisition, we are still an independent software company. What changed is that instead of having an external shareholder, we now have an internal shareholder,\u201d he explained.Founded in 1993, Red Hat is credited for bringing open source -- including technologies like Linux, Kubernetes, Ansible, Java and Ceph, among others -- into the mainstream for the enterprises. Today, Red Hat products and services are widely used by government agencies as well as emerging companies in technology, finance, healthcare, civil aviation and other industries.Armonk, New York-headquartered IBM particularly hopes that Red Hat\u2019s open hybrid Cloud technologies would help it position itself as a leading hybrid Cloud provider.\u201cAt the core of what we do is turning projects in the open source communities into products because at the end of the day, our customer is an enterprise software customer,\u201d Allessio said.\u201cI think it is an opportunity for IBM to learn this DNA of Red Hat -- how do we do it -- and decide -- they have not yet decided -- if this applies to the IBM software development process. IBM has already stated that they are very much interested in our services division,\u201d Allessio added.IBM also participates in open source communities, but it does not \u201cproductise\u201d the open source projects. Instead, it develops its own proprietary products.What has fundamentally changed after the acquisition is that IBM is no longer just a business partner for Red Hat, it is now a strategic business partner.\u201cFrom a go to market to operations, development and support, IBM does not help Red Hat.

That said, Redmi K20 Pro\u2019s lowlight performance isn\u2019t any better or worse than OnePlus 7 Pro. There\u2019s very little difference between the two phones when it comes low light shots.Redmi K20 Pro: Lowlight performanceRedmi K20 Pro: Using modes, lensesXiaomi\u2019s Redmi K20 Pro comes with the 48-megapixel rear camera. It\u2019s the same Sony IMX586 sensor. The phone, however, offers much better details than its budget counterpart. Another upgrade you will notice is how fast the 48-megapixel photos are processed. The mode itself is still at nascent stages and it\u2019s likely to improve with future generations of the phone. For instance, who\u2019d not love to have an optical zoom with 48-megapixel sensors.The AI and HDR mode are on par with what you get on other phones. The features bring auto optimisation of your shot which makes a lot of sense for casual mobile photography enthusiasts. HDR mode is also satisfactory.","category":"tech","source":"ht","title":"Redmi K20 Pro camera review: Xiaomi steps up its camera game"},{"article":"With over 200 million monthly active users, WhatsApp is the most popular instant messaging app in India. Over the years, WhatsApp has improved the platform with new features such as video calling and stickers. Of late, WhatsApp has increased focus on bettering its security and privacy features, especially after it was widely criticised over the spread of fake news and misinformation.From the forwarded label, fact-check to suspicious link detection, WhatsApp has added multiple new features in last one year or so. WhatsApp recently revealed it bans over 2 million accounts per month for abusing the platform. While WhatsApp is fixing the spam and fake news problem, here are some of the top privacy and security features that every WhatsApp user needs to know.Two-step verificationTwo-step verification is possibly the easiest way to add another layer of security to your account. Google and Facebook also stress on having two-step verification. For WhatsApp, it helps you verify your account through a six-digit PIN that you create using the feature.To enable two-step verification, WhatsApp users need to visit Settings > Account > Two-step verification > Enable. You also have the option to enter your email address which can be used in the case you forget the six-digit PIN.Protecting WhatsApp profile photosWhatsApp doesn\u2019t come with Facebook\u2019s screen-guard feature that notifies users when someone copies or takes a screenshot of their profile photos. What WhatsApp users can do for now is tweaking the Settings to ensure their profile photo is only visible to their contacts. You can also set the profile photos\u2019 visibility to no one. Here\u2019s how to do it: Go to Settings > Account > Privacy > Profile Photos > Choose between \u201cEveryone\u201d, \u201cMy Contacts\u201d and \u201cNobody.\u201dALSO\u2009READ:\u2009WhatsApp to soon add QR\u2009Code support, here\u2019s how it worksReporting, blocking and moreSecurity notificationsIf you\u2019re receiving spams from an unknown number, here\u2019s what you need to do. Open the chat, tap on the sender name (individual or group) to open their profile. Scroll to the bottom and tap \u201cReport Contact\u201d or \u201cReport group.\u201d You can also block the number. Users can also exit the group that is sending spam.When enabled, the feature alerts users when a contact\u2019s security code has changed. \u201cSecurity codes are just visible versions of the special key shared between you - and don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not the actual key itself, that\u2019s always kept secret. At times, the security codes used in end-to-end encryption might change. This is likely because you or your contact reinstalled WhatsApp or changed phones,\u201d explains WhatsApp on its website.To activate this feature, launch WhatsApp on your phone. Go to Settings > tap on Account > Security > toggle the button to \u201cShow Security Notifications.\u201dNote that WhatsApp offers end-to-end encryption regardless of this setting.","category":"tech","source":"ht","title":"WhatsApp\u2019s top security, privacy features that every user needs to know"},{"article":"Sure, I like privacy in the abstract. But I\u2019m applying for an apartment in New York City, and I just sent out my only slightly redacted W-2, credit history and screenshots of my bank account to several people just because they said they\u2019re real estate brokers.So I cannot judge the thousands of Americans who sent in a picture of themselves to a Russian-made smartphone application that they hadn\u2019t heard of the day before. FaceApp is a viral app that allows people to create startlingly realistic images of themselves as seniors or as children. And this week, it incited a panic as reports emerged that people using the app were sending their images to a little-known Russian company for doctoring.The scandal is not surprising. Whether it\u2019s a hip thing like FaceApp (literally all it does is age you)\u2014or the age-old torture of applying for an urban apartment\u2014it doesn\u2019t take much to get any of us to hand over our data.I have no idea whether people should be wary of FaceApp in particular. Security researchers have found no evidence that it sucks up all your photos or does anything similarly nefarious. The company said it deletes most images within 48 hours and that it will remove user data upon request.The fact that it\u2019s Russian isn\u2019t enough to discredit it. But Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has called for an FBI investigation. And if we were living in a movie, the all-powerful facial recognition machine that brings humanity to its knees would certainly be built on the back of viral human vanity.Facebook\u2019s opponents argue that by breaking it up, its various pieces and their competitors would be forced to compete by offering superior privacy protections. But with so many people so willing to trade their data for convenience (or a discount, or an apartment, or a face filter), the invisible hand of the market probably won\u2019t\u00a0protect us from tech overreach.The most obvious answer is privacy regulation. This is why we elect leaders to create a regulatory state to watch out for us.\u00a0I\u2019m not particularly interested in investigating the factory farm that pumps out the eggs that I buy. That\u2019s why I rely on the Food and Drug Administration to keep an eye on things.I\u2019m sure some privacy-minded people will object to this sort of\u00a0defeatism. Yes, people can take some responsibility for their privacy. As in, maybe do some background googling before downloading an app from a company that you\u2019ve never heard of? But more likely, people will just embrace the post-privacy dystopia. If regulators won\u2019t police the most obvious targets, Apple, Google and Facebook (which has even called for regulations!), I guess the Russians can enjoy looking at our smiling, na\u00efve faces.But in the absence of strong government oversight in the internet world, we\u2019ve had to rely on app stores and other log-in tools to protect us. That has some mixed results. And it\u00a0means the gatekeepers\u2014Apple Inc., Google and Facebook, in particular\u2014know a ton about us","category":"tech","source":"ht","title":"FaceApp may have your photo, but Facebook, Google know more about you"},{"article":"At a time when deepfake videos become a new threat to users\u2019 privacy, a team of Indian-origin researchers has developed Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven deep neural network that can identify manipulated images at the pixel level with high precision.Realistic videos that map the facial expressions of one person onto those of another -- known as deepfakes, present a formidable political weapon in the hands of nation-state bad actors.Led by Amit Roy-Chowdhury, professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California, Riverside, the team is currently working on still images but this can help them detect \u201cdeepfake\u201d videos.\u201cWe trained the system to distinguish between manipulated and nonmanipulated images and now if you give it a new image, it is able to provide a probability that that image is manipulated or not, and to localize the region of the image where the manipulation occurred,\u201d said Roy-Chowdhury.A deep neural network is what AI researchers call computer systems that have been trained to do specific tasks, in this case, recognize altered images. These networks are organized in connected layers; \u201carchitecture\u201d refers to the number of layers and structure of the connections between them.While this might fool the naked eye, when examined pixel by pixel, the boundaries of the inserted object are different.For example, they are often smoother than the natural objects. By detecting boundaries of inserted and removed objects, a computer should be able to identify altered images. The researchers tested the neural network with a set of images it had never seen before, and it detected the altered ones most of the time. It even spotted the manipulated region.\u201cIf you can understand the characteristics in a still image, in a video it\u2019s basically just putting still images together one after another,\u201d explained Roy-Chowdhury in a paper published in the journal IEEE Transactions on Image Processing.\u201cThe more fundamental challenge is probably figuring out whether a frame in a video is manipulated or not\u201d.Roy-Chowdhury, however, thinks we still have a long way to go before automated tools can detect \u201cdeepfake\u201d videos in the wild.Even a single manipulated frame would raise a red flag.\u201cThis is kind of a cat and mouse game. This whole area of cybersecurity is in some ways trying to find better defense mechanisms, but then the attacker also finds better mechanisms.","category":"tech","source":"ht","title":"Indian-origin scientists develop AI system to detect deepfakes"},{"article":"The wildly popular short video-sharing app TikTok is reportedly mulling to launch a host of new features that seem to have been inspired by Facebook-owned Instagram.The features were discovered by reverse-engineering specialist Jane Manchun Wong who posted screengrabs of the features on Twitter.The purported Instagram-inspired features include a grid-style layout, an account switcher and a Discover page, among others.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re always experimenting with new ways to improve the app experience for our community,\u201d the spokesperson was quoted as saying by the TechCrunch on Saturday.The TikTok spokesperson, however, declined to offer further details about the company\u2019s plans but confirmed the features were things the company is working on.Earlier this week, speculation was rife that social networking giant Facebook was preparing the launch of a serious competitor to TikTok.Owned by a Beijing-based start-up named ByteDance, TikTok saw its first-time installs grow about 28 per cent year-over-year for the first half of 2019 to nearly 344 million globally despite a two-week ban in India during the second quarter (Q2), revealed an estimate by mobile app intelligence firm Sensor Tower.","category":"tech","source":"ht","title":"TikTok working on Instagram-like grid layout, explore feed"},{"article":"You will soon be able to know why certain tweets go unavailable in your conversation thread on Twitter.

Once a user has entered their payment information, the app not only remembers it, but also removes the choice to swap back to Google Play for future purchases, he wrote.\u201cThis is a huge difference,\u2019 Schachter said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly high-margin business for Google bringing in billions of dollars,\u2019 he said.The shares of Tinder\u2019s parent company, Match Group Inc., spiked 5% when Schachter\u2019s note was published on Thursday. Shares of Google parent Alphabet Inc. were little changed.Apple and Google launched their app stores in 2008, and they soon grew into powerful marketplaces that matched the creations of millions of independent developers with billions of smartphone users. In exchange, the companies take as much as 30% of revenue. The app economy is expected to grow to $157 billion in 2022, according to App Annie projections.As the market expands, a growing revolt has been gaining steam over the past year. Spotify Technology SA filed an antitrust complaint with the European Commission earlier this year, claiming the cut Apple takes amounts to a tax on competitors. Netflix Inc. has recently stopped letting Apple users subscribe via the App Store and Epic Games Inc. said last year it wouldn\u2019t distribute Fortnite, one of the world\u2019s most popular video games, through Google Play.Match declined to answer questions about whether the company was also investigating bypassing Apple\u2019s App Store.

Others have instead forced subscribers back to their own websites to enter payment information.\u201cTinder is relatively small and it won\u2019t have a massive impact, but the concern is if this grows and gets into gaming apps as it starts moving forward,\u2019 Schachter said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see a lot of other companies potentially trying to experiment with this.\u2019\u00a0","category":"tech","source":"ht","title":"Tinder to bypass Google Play Store with new payment process"},{"article":"The smartphone gaming scene is about to get very exciting.
