[{"title":"File your income tax returns or face penalties, jail time","article":"Did you know that the Income Tax (I-T) department allows you to file your ITR even after the due date? If you fail to pay by the deadline, you have the option to file the returns within the assessment year (AY), which is 2019-20. This means you can file a belated return till March 31, 2019, before the completion of assessment by the I-T department. However, it comes at a cost.The costIf you file your return after the due date but before December 31 of the assessment year, you will have to pay Rs 5,000 as penalty. If you file it between January 1 and March 31 of assessment year 2019-20, you will have to pay a late fee of Rs 10,000. This penalty is applicable for individuals who have an income above Rs 5 lakh. In case you file it between January 1 and March 31 of assessment year 2019-20 and your income is below Rs 5 lakh, you have to pay a penalty of up to Rs 1,000.\u201cPenalty is mandatory now. If you have missed the deadline, the tax returns can\u2019t be filed unless you pay the penalty. This came into effect last year,\u201d said Prakash Hegde, a Bengaluru-based chartered accountant. If you have tax to pay, the I-T department will charge interest on the due tax amount along with the penalty amount. Under section 234A, interest is levied for delay in filing the return of income. Interest is levied at 1% per month or part of a month. The nature of interest is simple interest. In other words, the taxpayer is liable to pay simple interest at 1% per month or part of a month for delay in filing the return of income. In case you fail to file your ITR altogether, the tax department can send you a notice and it can also lead to prosecution. The jail term can range from three months to two years if you fail to file your ITR. A term varies depending on the due tax amount. You can also get a jail term of up to seven years. \u201cAs per the law, prosecution proceeds can be initiate. Prosecution is an extreme step taken only if someone doesn\u2019t file in the required assessment year and amount involved is huge, or if the individual has undeclared money. Sometimes it is initiated if the income tax officer has issued a notice and taxpayer has not responded or filed the returns. It happens in exceptional cases,\u201d said Hegde.Considering that you will have to shell out a fee for late payment and can also face prosecution, it is advisable to file your returns on time. If you are not able to file your returns on your own, you can seek help from a chartered accountant, financial planner, financial advisor, or tax portals.Remember that if you don\u2019t file your returns on time, you will not be allowed to carry forward certain losses to subsequent years.","category":"business"},{"title":"Made a mistake in filing IT return?

However, income can come to you in the form of interest from your bank account. Also, even if you don\u2019t have to pay tax on the income, you still need to report it. There are multiple reasons why you might miss out on mentioning your income or wrongly report the income. Here are some provisions that you need to be careful with.Report long-term capital gains in your ITRA sale of equity shares or units of equity-oriented funds that result in longterm capital gains must be reported in your income tax returns (ITR). \u201cThese are taxed at a concessional rate of 10% on the gains in excess of Rs1 lakh without providing the benefits of indexation.If your total gains are less than Rs1 lakh, those must also be reported. Those who have reinvested their receipts from sale of mutual funds or equity shares into a similar asset or any other asset must report the sale transaction in their tax returns and pay capital gains (short-term or longterm as applicable). Long-term capital gains on debt fund are taxed at the rate of 20% after indexation. You must add short-term gains from debt funds to your overall income Even if tax is deducted on salary and tax deducted at source (TDS) is paid on your interest income, you may still notice that there are some taxes due. TDS normally get deducted at 10% if you provide your permanent account number (PAN). And if you are at a higher tax slab rate, then the TDS has been deducted at a lower rate. This means that you have to pay the remaining tax after calculating it. After you pay the tax due, either online or offline, it gets reflected. Hence, you should cross-check all your investment and withdrawals and the TDS details before filing your returns so that you don\u2019t miss out on any of the tax dues. Report all you incomes As a salaried individual, since your main source of income is your salary, you may assume that you just have to report income from salary.However, at the least you may also get income in the form of interest from your savings bank account. You will get a statement of your interest income from your bank regularly. Though you may argue that the amount is low, you still need to report the income even if you don\u2019t have to pay a tax. You may also have another source of income in the form of maturity of your fixed deposit, recurring deposit or any kind of cash gifts or bonuses you have received in the financial year. Even if your income is tax-free, you must report it in your ITR to avoid any errors.Mention all tour investment. If you have invested in financial instruments and had a loss, you should mention this while filing your returns. This is to set off and carry forward your capital loss. In case you don\u2019t mention it, it will not get adjusted and you will end up paying more tax than required. Through reporting your income correctly, your tax outgo is unlikely to be incorrect. You can collect all the details from the source of income. If you are not clear on how to declare all your income for taxation, you can seek help of a chartered accountant or a financial advisor. You can also use online portals to fill in the details.","category":"business"},{"title":"How to file Income Tax Returns yourself","article":"It is the time of the year when everybody is busy filing their income tax returns (ITR). Though the current deadline to file your ITR is July 31, the government is likely to extend this owing to the delay in the release of Form 16 \u2014 a document required by salaried individuals for the process.Usually, Form 16 is supposed to be issued by your employer by June 15. This year, the date was extended to July 10. Even if there is a change in the deadline, you still have to file your ITR. Hence, instead of waiting for the last date, you should do it right away. Did you know that you can file your ITR yourself? Usually, individuals seek help from a chartered accountant or financial advisor to do the ITR process. However, this time if you are planning to do it on your own, here is the process.Step 1The first thing you need to do is collect all the relevant documents required to file your ITR. The Income Tax (I-T) department doesn\u2019t ask you to attach any of the documents during the filing process, but you will need the documents to fill the details.Since you have to fill your personal details, you will need your Permanent Account Number (PAN) card and Aadhaar card. You will also need Form 16, Form 16A, details of dividends, long-term and short-term capital gains statements, interest statement of your bank account and any other income-related documents. Since you also have to cross-check details of taxes paid earlier, you will require your TDS certificate and 26AS.

You just need to have some knowledge of the taxation and ability to operate the website. However, if you have to file ITR-2 or ITR-3, then it is suggested that you take the help of a chartered accountant or tax return preparer (TRP) as these are more complex,\u201d said Naveen Wadhwa, deputy general manager, Taxmann.com, a tax service provider.

A bench of Justices R F Nariman and Surya Kant said the monitoring committee will continue its work till the case is heard on August 7.\u201cOnce the Committee of Creditors (CoC) in their concerned wisdom had decided on division of assets, there should have been no re-distribution, like you are an Interim Resolution Professional (IRP). We would settle this issue once and for all,\u201d the bench observed at the outset.The bench was hearing a plea by CoC of Essar Steel challenging NCLAT\u2019s July 4 order which approved steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal-led ArcelorMittal\u2019s Rs 42,000 crore bid for acquiring the debt-laden firm.The COC has sought quashing of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) order which had given financial creditors equal status with operational creditors in the distribution of the ArcelorMittal\u2019s bid amount. Essar Steel was auctioned under the new Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) to recover Rs 54,547 crore of unpaid dues of financial lenders and operational creditors.In its July 4 order, the NCLAT had said that financial creditors will get 60.7 per cent of their admitted claims of Rs 49,473 crore, almost same as operational creditors.The operational creditors with admitted claim amount of less than Rs 1 crore would get 100 per cent, while above Rs 1 crore would get 60.26 per cent and workmen and employees would get 100 per cent. The tribunal had said that the CoC will have no role in the distribution of Rs 42,000 crore and allowed claims of the operational creditors such as Dakshin Gujarat, Gujarat Energy, Bharat Petroleum, Indian Oil, GAIL, ONGC, and the NTPC.ArcelorMittal had told the NCLAT that it would pay Rs 42,000 crore, including a minimum guarantee of Rs 2,500 crore as working capital, for acquiring Essar Steel under the insolvency process.The tribunal said the apex court had settled the issue of eligibility of ArcelorMittal India and could not be re-opened before the Appellate Authority at a stage where the \u2018Resolution Plan\u2019 approval was being considered. The Ahmedabad-bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on March 8 approved the bid submitted by ArcelorMittal India for the takeover of Essar Steel.Essar Steel director Prashant Ruia had challenged the order saying ArcelorMittal was ineligible to bid under Section 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code as it was associated with delinquent or loan defaulting firms.ArcelorMittal had claimed that Ruia\u2019s plea was one of the multiple mala fide attempts to derail the corporate insolvency resolution process. The operational creditors had opposed ArcelorMittal\u2019s resolution plan saying they were getting notional payment, while 92.5 per cent of the debt of financial creditors was being paid.In its order, the NCLAT had said that the amount of profit generated by Essar Steel during the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) cannot be given to the successful resolution applicant ArcelorMittal as it has not invested any money.

Here\u2019s an edited transcript of the topics he covered in the more than 50 minute interview.On the economic slowdown and the RBI\u2019s response:\u2018The accommodative stance will depend on incoming data. How inflation numbers look how the growth numbers look. Primarily how inflation looks. With regard to the slowdown, I would not give a particular timeline and it\u2019s not possible. But overall if you see the trend, I think the fourth quarter of last year was partly a base effect and partly due to investment slowdown and demand contraction, which I had articulated in the monetary policy committee minutes. For that, so far as monetary authority is concerned, the law gives us a certain role and mandate and we have tried our best to play that role. We have reduced the policy rates by 75 basis points and we have shifted to accommodative. And shifting of the stance to accommodative itself means a rate cut of 25 basis points at least. So therefore effectively, the rate cuts has been 100 basis points if you take into account the change in stance.\u2019On providing liquidity:\u2018Parallel to that we have also ensured surplus liquidity in the system. Liquidity was in deficit but at the moment for the past 1 1\/2 months, the system is in liquidity surplus by more than 1 trillion rupees.\u201cWe will ensure the banks are provided adequate funds. While the system is in surplus mode, it is possible that one or two banks may have liquidity issues. Given the role the RBI is assigned, inflation is primary target, and given due weightage to the fact that growth momentum has slowed down. For the revival, various stakeholders have to play the role.\u2019 On investment slowdown:\u2018There have been sectoral problems, like in the auto sector. Our survey shows that additional insurance requirements has had an impact. So every sector has had its problem. But when the world is changing you also have to change. Then there was the credit squeeze; now availability is there. The banks were unable to lend significantly, burdened with NPAs and the focus of the banks was on recovery and consolidation and not on credit. The banks are now in a better position to lend. While banks were not lending, NBFC entered their space. But for a year or so, credit flow has been affected. Another thing I would like to address the crowding out effect. It\u2019s a good thing that the fiscal deficit has been brought down and recapitalization has been announced. Every stakeholder, the government, the private sector and the RBI are playing their role and I think things are moving in the right direction. And things should improve now.\u2019On liquidity and NBFC problems:\u2018We have to constantly monitor and remain alert as the regulator and as a monetary authority. We have to analyse and review the situation. Here at the RBI, we have broad medium and long-term goals. If some issue becomes critical, not a day passes without some internal high-level review. On NBFC, not a day passed in the last several months where we don\u2019t have a discussion or a review internally. Either on the sector or individual NBFCs. And we are monitoring the top 50 NBFCs which we have identified in terms of balance sheet size, volume of operation and in terms of governance practices and credit behavior. Our supervision teams are closely monitoring them. We are in constant interaction with the banks and it\u2019s our endeavor to ensure a collapse of another NBFC, especially a large one, doesn\u2019t happen. Having said that, if NBFCs have undertaken certain governance practice and certain ways of function and they have to a price for it, they will have to pay a price for it.\u2019On banks being proactive: Consolidation in NBFCs:\u2018If somebody has diverted or there has been sort of ever-greening, there has been gold plating, if there has not been so diligent lending, so obviously they have to pay the price. Our effort is to segregate the way there have been lapses. Our focus is the overall system maintains stability. When I say system, it obviously includes all the major players. Therefore, our effort is to see that there is no repeat instances of systemically important large NBFC collapsing. And in the process some promoters have to make certain sacrifices, promoters have to accept haircut, the banks will have to deal with it appropriately within the parameters. One or two cases, the banks have signed inter-creditor agreements and they are resolving this crisis. The way I look at it, the responsibility is on the NBFCs themselves, to find market instruments to resolve their problems. Market instruments and the promoter has to bring in additional capital, he has to do a stake sale, he has to securitize his assets and mobilize liquidity, he has to meet debt obligations. And then the role of the lenders. We are in discussion with the lenders who have to protect their money also. They also have a parallel role to try and resolve this issue. That will also mean sacrifice on the part of the promoter also. The RBI will ensure adequate liquidity to banks.\u2019On refinancing:\u2018This Refinance window or a liquidity window is a misnomer. We cannot lend money directly to one NBFC. Under the law, RBI is the lender of last resort, but we haven\u2019t reached that situation where we invoke that particular legal provision. So RBI in today\u2019s time cannot and would not be lending directly to NBFCs. We cannot give them clean money. It is up to the bank and depending on the collateral. We are backing up the banks. There is nothing called a liquidity window. Money is fungible, and when money is fungible having these windows, I think, is not relevant.\u2019When will the crisis be over? On the risk of dollar depreciation:\u2018If they depreciate their currencies, it means greater inflows. When the reversal happens we have to manage spillover effect. If excess inflow comes in, it becomes a problem to absorb excess liquidity. It\u2019s an evolving challenge. We will continue to deal with it. We have to keep in mind, in several advanced economies, bonds yields are negative, inflation is zero. In fact in my interaction with other central bankers, they are concerned about zero or low inflation. They would like to have a slightly higher inflation. Zero interest rates prevailing for far too long, it becomes unsustainable and undermines investor sentiment. In the overall context, India is much better than most other economies.\u2019On structural reforms:\u2018I don\u2019t think the fiscal space is really the answer. If you have fiscal space any government can use. Long-term growth can be sustained by structural reforms, enhancing competitiveness, and focusing on an enabling business environment. So therefore, GST, IBC and the Niti Aayog\u2019s committee on agriculture reforms, which will allow private investment in the farm sector and which will ensure better price to farmers for their produce, are crucial. The supply chain in the agricultural sector has to be addressed. The focus will have to be on structural reforms and improving competitiveness. Focus will have to be on continued ease of business and availability of credit at a reasonable priceOn interest-rate transmission:\u2018There is a case for banks to show better monetary policy transmission. We have to keep in mind that banks have gone through a period of crisis and they are just recovering, they are just about recovering, so that aspect has also to be kept in mind. So if you drive and ask them to fix interest rates administratively, we cannot lose sight of the fact that banks will also have to recover and comeback to a level where they are out of the woods. If we see the PCA banks have fulfilled the conditions to come, they will come.","category":"business"},{"title":"Decoding new fund offer for you","article":"What is New Fund Offer (NFO)? Whenever a fund company launches a new mutual fund, it conducts the launch through a process known as a new fund offer (NFO).\u201cThis applies to both, open- and closed-ended mutual funds. In an NFO, you can subscribe to the units of the new fund, which is being launched, at an offer price which is usually set as Rs 10. So if you invest Rs 1 lakh, you will be allotted 1,000 units. An NFO can be cancelled if the investors do not show much interest in subscribing to it,\u201d said Ankur Choudhary, co-founder and chief investment officer, Goalwise.com. For example, equity schemes are required to get a minimum total investment of Rs 1 crore during an NFO. \u201cThe main objective of an NFO is to raise capital from markets to further invest in various asset classes such as stocks and bonds,\u201d said Vijay Kuppa, co-founder, Orowealth.What is Further Fund Offer (FFO)?\u201cAfter the NFO, an open-ended mutual fund becomes available for purchase and redemption on an on-going basis at the net asset value (NAV) published by the fund house,\u201d said Choudhary. However, it is different with close-ended funds. \u201cNew units for closedended funds may only be issued through a Further Fund Offer (FFO).In an FFO, new units are made available for fresh purchase to existing or new investors at an offer price which is close to the current NAV of the fund. FFO allows the fund to take in much more investments after its initial subscription,\u201d said Choudhary. A fund can have any number of NFOs. \u201cFFOs\u2019 offer price is referred to as a reference market price and is in line with the current traded price. Several times, you will be given FFOS at a discounted market price,\u201d said Singh. What you do with NFO and FFO?\u201cIn general, it is not a good idea to subscribe to NFOS because there is no track record for that fund. And today there is no dearth of funds with good tracks in any theme, so it does not make much sense to invest in an NFO,\u201d said Chowdhary. In the case of FFOs of closed-ended funds or exchange-traded fund (ETF), you still have a performance history to monitor.\u201cIn an FFO of a closed-ended fund or ETF, the experts have recommend investors to evaluate the track record of the fund, its expense ratio and the returns till date. The NFOs or FFOs are not like initial public offering (IPO) in the stock market, in the sense that they don\u2019t offer any scope for quick returns that investors generally tend to associate with IPOs.\u201d Chowdhary added.","category":"business"},{"title":"3 things you must know before using credit card","article":"If you use your credit card wisely, it can turn into a useful tool for your money management. However, many consider credit card as a bad financial product to have in your wallet. If you are new to use a credit card or if you are considering opting for one, here are three basic things you should know:Make use of your card\u2019s grace period All credit cards come with a grace period to pay the bill. Grace period is the time given to you to pay back the money you spent using the credit card, without paying an interest.Usually credit cards come with 50 days grace period. For instance, if your billing cycle starts on the 11th of every month, your due date will be 50 days\u2014which is 30th of the next month.Hence, if you make a purchase at the 11th of the month you will get the entire 50 days\u2019 grace period to pay the bill. Paying bills on or before the due date means you don\u2019t have to pay any interest. Also when you are disciplined with your credit card bill payment, you will see a positive impact on your credit score and credit history. Don\u2019t withdraw cash using a credit cardOne of the most expensive ways to use your credit card is to withdraw cash from the automated teller machine (ATM). Don\u2019t use your credit card like your debit card. Here your interest rate kicks in as soon as you withdraw money from the ATM. Unlike when you swipe your card and get a grace period, the ATM withdrawal doesn\u2019t have a grace period.Hence, avoid using credit cards for cash withdrawals. Usually the limit on ATM withdrawals is lower than the credit card limit.Usually all credit cards have charges such as annual fee, joining fee and late payment charges. Most credit cards have similar structure. However, the charges can differ based on added services. Hence, you should compare the fees and understand the cost of the credit card before opting for one. Also you should check the reward points and the value of it as it varies across the credit card platform. Some credit card companies waive off credit card fees completely too. You can also negotiate with the bank to bring down the cost.When you start using a credit card make sure to not go overboard on spending. Also remember that if you don\u2019t pay your bills on time, the interest rate is around 22-48% per annum, which is the highest in the market.","category":"business"},{"title":"Your life insurance plans get tweaked","article":"The Insurance Regulatory Development Authority of India (Irdai) has simplified product regulations for the unit-linked products and non linked products. Let\u2019s take a deeper look at the changes suggested by the regulator that may have an impact on you.The revival period has been increased to three years in case of unitlinked products and five years in case of non-linked products from two years. The revival period is the period offered by insurers to revive the policy after you missed paying the premiums after the policy lapses and also during the grace period. \u201cThe extension in the revival period will provide customers a wider window to revive their policy,\u201d said Tarun Chugh, MD and CEO, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance. With the increase in duration, you will get some flexibility in policy premium payment.There have also been some changes in the minimum sum assured of linked and non-linked products. \u201cFor regular premium and limited premium paying policy is reduced to seven times the annualised premiums, irrespective your age when you purchase the policy. For single premium policy, the sum assured is 125% of single premium, again irrespective of your entry age,\u201d said RM Vishakha, MD and CEO, Indiafirst Life Insurance.This might be a bit problematic. \u201cThe death benefit has been reduced to seven times from 10 times and according to the tax regulations, only if the death benefit is 10 times the annual premiums it is eligible for tax benefits.,\u201d said Mehta. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.defineSlot('\/1055314\/HT_Desk_In-story_Top_728x90', [[728, 90],[1, 1]], 'div-gpt-ad-1536739653096-0').addService(googletag.pubads()).setCollapseEmptyDiv(true,true); googletag.pubads().enableSingleRequest(); googletag.enableServices(); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1536739653096-0'); }); The regulator has also allowed partial withdrawal in Ulip pension plans. You can withdraw up to 25% of the fund value for education or marriage of your children, treatment of critical illness, purchase or construction of residential house.\u201cThe sum assured payable on death shall be reduced to the extent of the partial withdrawals made during the two-year period preceding the death,\u201d added Vishakha. Earlier no partial withdrawals were allowed in these plans.\u201cIn respect of pension products, the option for commutation up to 60% is allowed. Up to 50% of the corpus (net of commutation) can be used to buy annuity from another insurer,\u201d Mohit Garg, head- products, PNB Metlife. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.defineSlot('\/1055314\/HT_Desk_In-story_Middle_728x90', [728, 90], 'div-gpt-ad-1536739752330-0').addService(googletag.pubads()).setCollapseEmptyDiv(true,true); googletag.pubads().enableSingleRequest(); googletag.enableServices(); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1536739752330-0'); }); At the time of retirement, if you need lump sum amount, pension products allow you to take a portion of the accumulated money as lump sum. In financial parlance, this is called commutation. It basically means an upfront payment of your pension money.\u201cThis makes a distinct difference, as a customer can now receive the annuity proceeds as 60:20:20 i.e. commute 60% of the amount, and purchase annuity such that 20% is bought from the original insurer through whom the pension plan was purchased and the remaining 20% can be bought from any other insurance provider\u201d, said Vishakha.Changes in premium googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.defineSlot('\/1055314\/HT_Desk_In-story_Middle_728x90', [728, 90], 'div-gpt-ad-1536739752330-1').addService(googletag.pubads()).setCollapseEmptyDiv(true,true); googletag.pubads().enableSingleRequest(); googletag.enableServices(); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1536739752330-1'); }); Your premiums will be reduced up to 50% of the original annual premium after you make the payment of the full five years\u2019 premium. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.defineSlot('\/1055314\/HT_Desk_In-story_Middle_728x90', [728, 90], 'div-gpt-ad-1536739752330-1').addService(googletag.pubads()).setCollapseEmptyDiv(true,true); googletag.pubads().enableSingleRequest(); googletag.enableServices(); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1536739752330-1'); }); \u201cThis is not a price benefit but just an option for policy flexibility. If you pay your five-year premium upfront, then the rest of the five years you will be able to pay 50% of your premium with a reduced sum assured,\u201d said Goel.\u201cIn non-ulips risk products, the cover period as small as a month can be offered, thereby enabling more and more customers to fulfil their life goals through insurance and making it more affordable,\u201d said Chugh. This regulation can come in handy for the insured.\u201cIn non-linked products there are two kinds: savings product and prerisk product, which are essentially your term plans and this regulation is for your term plans. You will be able to buy a term plan for a month now and it might come handy if you are going for a longer holiday,\u201d said Mehta.

Irdai is in the process of releasing the method and time of implementation of these regulations.

In a research conducted in September last year by Manipalcigna Health Insurance, 95% of Indian millennials are stressed at work as against the global average of 86%. It\u2019s natural for us to go to a resort in a weekend getaway and recharge ourselves for the upcoming week. It is only prudent for us to make calculated plans so that our future does not get compromised. Mumbai-based couple Krutarth Vashi, 26, a process manager at HDFC Bank Ltd and Shruti Sengunthar, 26, a strategic network manager at Tata Motors Ltd, love to travel and take at least two trips in a month. \u201cThe type of trip varies with the season. For instance, we avoid trekking destinations when it\u2019s warm and prefer a road trip or trek during monsoons,\u201d said Vashi.The couple has also begun to make custom-made plans for travel enthusiasts and go by the name Mastaane Musafir on Instagram. \u201cAround 90% of our travel plans are without the help of a tour guide or a planner as we prefer non-tourist locations to cut down on the costs. We spend around Rs 6,000 to Rs 7,000 on an average for a short weekend trip for two and the number inches up for slightly longer trips,\u201d said Sengunthar.The key to travelling cost-effectively is to plan well in advance. \u201cWe generally go for cheaper hotels but it depends on where we are visiting. Last year, we visited Udaipur and the essence of the city is in its royalty. So we booked a room for a day in one of its palaces. Sure it came at a steep cost, but that day we did not arrange for any other activities and just spent our entire day exploring the palace and made optimum utilisation of the money spent. The next day we moved into a cheaper accommodation and completed other activities,\u201d she added.There should at least be a three months\u2019 gap for longer duration trips or the shorter ones which are expensive. \u201cWe also prefer booking refundable flights because you never know what will happen in future,\u201d she adds.Besides keeping money aside for weekend getaways, the couple generally invests in equity funds, debt funds and hybrid funds and keeps a big portion of the amount as liquid cash for emergency purposes, which is aligned with their long-term and short-term goals. \u201cOur goal is to prepare for the worst in the future, because we cannot spend whatever we earn in enjoyment,\u201d he added.However, not everyone has a higher frequency of travel in a shorter duration. For instance, Anisha Sharma, 27, deputy manager at National Stock Exchange goes for a short weekend trip in a month and a big trip once in a quarter. \u201cI probably spend 30% of my annual salary,\u201d said Sharma, who stays with her family so she saves money that otherwise would\u2019ve gone towards rental accommodations. \u201cI always opt for budget hotels to save on my travel cost and plan reasonably. The only thing I have in mind is to plan in advance, so that I avoid any money crunch, and fortunately I have yet not encountered any such situation,\u201d she added.What goes wrong usually? \u201cA lot of fellow travellers we meet believe what is the point of thinking about what will happen in the future. This is where they go wrong. Another common behaviour we have noticed is when people face financial issues after a travel plan, they end up blaming the trip and time of the planning,\u201d said Sengunthar.These travellers seem to be going the right way according to experts. \u201cYou should indeed not spend more than 10-15% of your income net of your regular expenses. These regular expenses would include your monthly rent and other such payments. So in case you live with your parents, your income net of your expenses automatically goes up and the amount you save in that 10-15% bracket will also go up,\u201d said Rachit Chawla, founder and CEO, Finway- a Delhi based financial advisory firm.An \u201cimpromptu\u201d plan may give you a momentary thrill but it should not be made at the cost of sabotaging your future.","category":"business"},{"title":"IMF says Pakistan needs to mobilize tax revenue, cut debt","article":"Pakistan needs to mobilize domestic tax revenue to ensure funds for social and development programs, while reducing debt, the acting director of the International Monetary Fund said on Sunday after a meeting with Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan.The two officials discussed recent economic developments and implementation of Pakistan\u2019s IMF-supported economic reforms, which are aimed at stabilizing the economy, strengthening institutions and paving the way for sustainable and balanced growth, David Lipton said in a statement.Khan\u2019s government faces mounting pressure as rising prices and tough austerity policies under Pakistan\u2019s latest bailout from the IMF are squeezing the middle class that helped carry it to power.Lipton said the IMF and other international partners were working closely with the Pakistani government to support implementation of the reforms. \u201cI highlighted the need to mobilize domestic tax revenue now and on into the future to provide reliably for needed social and development spending, while placing debt on a firm downward trend,\u201d Lipton said in a statement after the meeting.Also read| Imran has nothing new to promise, US visit will be weak on substance: Ex-Pak diplomatKhan, who arrived in Washington on Sunday, is due to meet with US President Donald Trump at the White House on Monday.

For a business to survive in a space as vast as the internet, it\u2019s vital that they can draw the right audience towards their brand. The most cost-effective method to attract the right audience is online promotion.There are endless numbers of digital marketing tricks and tactics that can be used to increase a brand\u2019s revenue. However, not all these tactics are created equal. Professional marketers have advanced strategies up their sleeves. These tactics are effective for helping businesses, small and big, boost their bottom line. Here are a few digital marketing tricks that can increase website traffic and drive an organization\u2019s revenue.Optimize Your WebsiteSetting up a website for the first time is a time-consuming process. When first creating a website, organizations spend a great deal of time designing the website to be user-friendly and responsive along with a beautiful layout and the right content.However, only a few revisit their website once it\u2019s launched. To ensure that your website attracts the target audience, it\u2019s important that it is regularly updated and regular SEO audits are carried out. Why? Because web designs and SEO best practices change over time. To remain competitive, a website will need to be optimized based on the latest trends. Search Engine Optimization is a part of digital marketing that covers a number of different tactics all the way from website design to blogging. A good website is easy to navigate and user-friendly. To get to the top in search results, it\u2019s essential that the website is SEO optimized with trending keywords and phrases. Furthermore, the website must be well-formatted, and keywords must be placed strategically in different pages.Promote Your BrandThere are various avenues for promotion in the world of digital marketing - paid search, social media advertising, and display advertising. These methods are great ways to build a brand, attract the right audience, and directing them to a website. Before you start investing in advertising, it\u2019s essential that you identify a goal and create a strategy to reach said goal. For instance, the approach to drive more traffic to a website would be different than a plan to increase conversions. Lastly, it\u2019s important to remember that each promotion channel has its own set of pros and cons; therefore, you must consider your objectives carefully before spending a penny.Apart from the statistics mentioned above, video marketing also positively affects social shares, SEO, credibility and trust. It\u2019s easy to understand why videos are starting to dominate the digital landscape. The fact that video marketing can be conversational, actionable, and measurable makes it the perfect marketing tool.With the number of businesses that are now online, it\u2019s getting increasingly challenging to stay relevant in the market. Therefore, it\u2019s essential that any organization takes the time to identify goals and the right digital marketing efforts that will help in reaching these goals. Once these factors are determined, it\u2019s time to start making and implementing strategies that will lead to positive results. On the other hand, you could choose to consult with the right digital marketing agency who can amplify your results in the optimum budget.","category":"business"},{"title":"\u2018Don\u2019t privatise public sector banks\u2019: Jairam Ramesh to Centre","article":"A demand was raised in Rajya Sabha Friday that the government come out with a categorical declaration that public sector banks would not be privatised.Raising the issue through a special mention, former Union Minister Jairam Ramesh (Cong) said it was former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi who on July 19, fifty years ago had nationalised 14 private sector banks.\u201cThis had profound immediate implication and had fuelled green revolution and resulted in rural development\u201d, he said, adding it also led to growth of self help groups and catalysed economic growth.Ramesh said it was the move that saved India from the impact of severe global financial crisis and recently led to appointment of Managing Director of the State Bank of India as CFO of the World Bank. \u201cI urge the government to come out with a categorical declaration against privatisation of public sector banks\u201d, he said ,adding the govenrment should not bring down its stake below 51 per cent holding as private funds had their stakes in banks.\u201cI urge the govenrment not to go ahead with the privatisation of the public sector banks,\u201d Ramesh added.","category":"business"},{"title":"Fashion retailer Koovs registers 8.6% increase in revenue in FY19","article":"Online fashion retailer Koovs Plc. reported an 8.6% rise in revenues for FY19, up to Rs 59 crore from Rs 54.3 crore reported in 2017-18, according to the company\u2019s annual report.\u201cKoovs is firmly back on track, evidenced by the 104% growth in Q1 trading.

This is in line with the estimates by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as well as the chief economic adviser in the finance ministry Krishnamurthy Subramanian.This mainly reflects \u201cthe unexpectedly weak FY2018 outturn\u201d, ADB said in its supplement to the Asian Development Outlook released on Thursday.Gross domestic product (GDP) growth in India in the fourth quarter of FY19 slowed down more than expected to 5.8% from 6.6% in the previous quarter. This was the lowest quarterly GDP growth rate in five years. Annual GDP growth in FY19 decelerated to 6.8% from 7.2% in 2017-18.\u201cThe slowdown was broadbased, with private consumption and investment growth slowing from previous quarters. On the supply side, agriculture and manufacturing grew more slowly as services picked up a bit,\u201d ADB said.However, the bank expects India\u2019s growth to inch up again to 7.2% in FY21, \u201chelped by recent reforms to improve the business climate, strengthen banks, and relieve agrarian distress.\u201dADB said agriculture is expected to grow at a healthy rate in 2019-20 as current weather trends indicate a normal monsoon. \u201cModeration in growth prospects for the advanced economies could adversely affect tradable services, this drag on growth mitigated by a more competitive currency and benign oil prices,\u201d it said.However, the US decision to end preferential trade treatment for India under its generalised system of preferences will have minimal effect as it benefited only 1.8% of all Indian exports, the report said. In light of a smaller-than-expected uptick in food inflation, a strengthening Indian rupee since October 2018, and a lower GDP growth forecast, the report revised downwards inflation forecasts for India by 0.2 percentage points to 4.1% in 2019-20 and 4.4% in 2020-21.The RBI, however, expects retail inflation to be around 3.0-3.1% for the April to September period of 2019-20 and is expected to cut policy rates for the fourth consecutive time in August. ADB said deepening trade tensions between the US and China constitute the main risk to its growth outlook for developing Asia. US-China negotiations broke down in May, prompting the US to increase the tariff rate on $200 billion worth of imports from China from 10% to 25%. It also threatened tariffs on another $300 billion of Chinese imports and imposed restrictions on doing business with the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. China retaliated by raising tariff rates on $60 billion worth of US imports.On June 28, China and the US called a truce to allow trade negotiations to restart and some restrictions on Huawei were lifted.","category":"business"},{"title":"Sensex drops over 200 points, Nifty below 11,550","article":"Domestic equity benchmark BSE Sensex dropped nearly 200 points in early trade Friday amid heavy foreign fund outflow and weak domestic headwinds.

The finance ministry on Tuesday slashed interest rate on General Provident Fund (GPF) and other similar funds to 7.9% for the quarter ending September 30 as compared to 8% offered on pension funds of government employees the previous quarter.Last month, the finance ministry wrote to the labour ministry to review its decision to offer 8.65% interest rate on two grounds; one pertained to the EPFO\u2019s decision to invest in financially troubled Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) group companies; the other was appropriation of surplus of the previous year. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.defineSlot('\/1055314\/HT_Desk_In-story_Middle_728x90', [728, 90], 'div-gpt-ad-1536739752330-0').addService(googletag.pubads()).setCollapseEmptyDiv(true,true); googletag.pubads().enableSingleRequest(); googletag.enableServices(); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1536739752330-0'); }); HT reported the matter on June 20. \u201cThe ministry of Labour and Employment is therefore advised to consider a rate of interest for FY 2018-19 which does not fully utilise the surplus of the previous year and leaves a reasonably higher surplus in the account undistributed,\u201d the finance ministry wrote to the labour secretary last month. The labour ministry replied to the finance ministry that the interest rate was fixed after keeping a reasonable surplus, which is more than Rs 3,150 crore, a second official said. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.defineSlot('\/1055314\/HT_Desk_In-story_Middle_728x90', [728, 90], 'div-gpt-ad-1536739752330-1').addService(googletag.pubads()).setCollapseEmptyDiv(true,true); googletag.pubads().enableSingleRequest(); googletag.enableServices(); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1536739752330-1'); }); The official said that a large part of this surplus came as returns from the investments it has made in ETFs over the past few years. \u201cETFs, based on Sensex 30 and Nifty 50, are relatively safe, with lower risk, and EPFO invests a part of its funds in such instruments. It appears that the mention of this surplus amount was missed when the matter was initially communicated to the finance ministry. Now, a full brief has been sent to the finance ministry,\u201d this official added.Official spokespersons of the labour ministry and EPFO did not respond to queries. EPFO,?on February 21, raised the interest rate on funds by 10 basis points from 8.55%, offered for 2017-18. CBT decides the annual interest rate offered to its subscribers, but as per the convention, it seeks the concurrence of the finance ministry before notifying this. The interest rate declaration has been delayed by about three months because of the finance ministry\u2019s objection, the first official said. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.defineSlot('\/1055314\/HT_Desk_In-story_Middle_728x90', [728, 90], 'div-gpt-ad-1536739752330-2').addService(googletag.pubads()).setCollapseEmptyDiv(true,true); googletag.pubads().enableSingleRequest(); googletag.enableServices(); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1536739752330-2'); }); Dr G Sanjeeva Reddy, president, Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC) and one of the CBT members, said, \u201cWith this kind of surplus we wanted the subscribers to get a 9% interest rate.

Guess who is?","article":"Bill Gates has never ranked lower than No. 2 in the seven-year history of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That run ended Tuesday when the Microsoft Corp. co-founder dropped to No. 3 behind France\u2019s Bernard Arnault.LVMH, Arnault\u2019s luxury-goods maker, advanced to a record Tuesday and pushed his net worth to $107.6 billion and ahead of Gates by more than $200 million. The shares extended their gains Wednesday, rising 0.7% at 1:54 pm in Paris. Arnault has added about $39 billion to his fortune in 2019 alone, the biggest individual gain by far among the 500 people in Bloomberg\u2019s ranking.Arnault, 70, joined Gates and Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos, the world\u2019s richest person, in the most exclusive wealth club last month, when his fortune surpassed $100 billion for the first time. The trio\u2019s collective wealth exceeds the individual market values of almost every company in the S&P 500 Index, including Walmart Inc., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Walt Disney Co.This year has been particularly good to French tycoons, with Arnault, Kering SA\u2019s Francois Pinault and cosmetics heir Francoise Bettencourt Meyers tacking on a combined $57 billion. Arnault and his family are among luxury titans who pledged more than $650 million in April for the reconstruction of Notre Dame Cathedral after fire ravaged the landmark church. He controls about half of Paris-based LVMH through a family holding company and also owns a 97% stake in Christian Dior, the fashion house founded three years before his birth in 1949.Arnault entered the luxury-goods market in 1984 by acquiring a textile group that owned Christian Dior. Four years later, he sold the company\u2019s other businesses and used the proceeds to buy a controlling stake in LVMH. His art collection of modern and contemporary paintings includes pieces by Jean-Michel Basquiat, Damien Hirst, Maurizio Cattelan, Andy Warhol and Pablo Picasso.Were it not for Gates\u2019s philanthropic giving, he\u2019d still be the world\u2019s richest person. Gates has donated more than $35 billion to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Bezos\u2019s net worth is up slightly this year to $125 billion, even after reaching a divorce settlement with MacKenzie Bezos that made her the world\u2019s fourth-richest woman.","category":"business"},{"title":"US knows it needs Federal Reserve to make a dent in the dollar","article":"Donald Trump needs help from one of his favorite punching bags, the Federal Reserve, if he truly wants to take action to weaken the dollar.The president has repeatedly brought up the idea of late. He tweeted this month that Europe and China are playing a \u201cbig currency manipulation game\u201d and called on the U.S. to \u201cMATCH, or continue being the dummies.\u201d He\u2019s made noise behind the scenes, too, lamenting to job candidates for the Fed board that the dollar\u2019s strength could blunt economic growth.Administration officials believe that for any move on the dollar to succeed, the Fed must agree with the policy and clearly communicate its support, according to people familiar with the matter. The Treasury Department and Fed have coordinated the last three U.S. currency interventions, splitting the amount transacted evenly between them in 1998, 2000 and 2011 in order to nudge the dollar\u2019s value.But even if the president prods the Treasury to sell dollars to drive the greenback\u2019s price down, the Fed is largely independent and there\u2019s no guarantee it would move in lockstep.The Treasury holds about $94 billion it could use to try to impact currency markets -- a relatively small sum considering foreign exchange is a more than $5-trillion-a-day business. The Fed\u2019s support would double the impact, assuming the two organizations again shared the cost 50-50. But if the Fed stayed on the sidelines, that would weaken the signal sent to markets, said PGIM Fixed Income chief economist Nathan Sheets.\u2018Justified\u2019 Move\u201cNot having the Fed on board would undermine the credibility of the intervention,\u201d said Sheets, a Treasury official during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. \u201cFed involvement would bring a technical endorsement, and strengthen the case that the move is justified by fundamentals.\u201dWhite House spokesmen didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment and a Fed spokesman declined to comment. A strong dollar gives U.S. consumers more money to buy imports while hurting exporters, widening trade deficits Trump\u2019s vowed to close. While Trump has recently asked candidates for two open seats on the Fed\u2019s board of governors about their views on the dollar, he hasn\u2019t directed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to intervene, Bloomberg News reported last week.The president\u2019s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, and Mnuchin both oppose any U.S. effort to weaken the dollar, according to people familiar with the matter. The people asked not to be identified discussing internal administration deliberations.Trump has grown concerned that the currency\u2019s strength will undermine the economy\u2019s performance ahead of his 2020 re-election, which has also fueled his criticism of the Fed. The central bank\u2019s trade-weighted measure of the greenback isn\u2019t far below the strongest level since 2002, underscoring the competitive headwinds American exports face. If Trump orders Mnuchin to intervene, it\u2019s unlikely that the Fed would follow Treasury\u2019s lead, said Mark Sobel, who used to manage the Treasury\u2019s Exchange Stabilization Fund, the pool of money the U.S. government would use. U.S. intervention traditionally takes place to address \u201cdisorderly conditions,\u201d not concerns about foreign-exchange levels, said Sobel, now U.S. chairman of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum. \u201cThe Fed has to make its own, independent decision\u201d based on evidence of \u201cmarket dysfunction or major market implications,\u201d he said. \u201cFed non-participation could send a divisive signal to markets, exacerbating, not reducing, volatility.\u201dNot everyone is convinced the Fed would stay out of the intervention. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. expects that the central bank would heed Treasury\u2019s decision, since Chairman Jerome Powell stated last month that the Treasury is responsible for the country\u2019s exchange rate policy, \u201cfull stop.\u201d\u201cIt is far from clear that the Fed would not participate,\u201d Goldman strategist Michael Cahill wrote in a July 11 note. \u201cThe Fed would probably defer to the Treasury and go along, even if it does not agree.\u201d Foreign-exchange traders have yet to price in the possibility of U.S. intervention, let alone a standoff between the Treasury and the Fed: global currency volatility is hovering near a five-year low. But analysts caution that further monetary stimulus from the European Central Bank could draw Trump\u2019s ire and raise the risk of intervention.The Fed would likely seek to chart a middle ground should such a situation arise, Sheets said. While the basis for intervention is not compelling, he said, the central bank runs the risk of drawing \u201cintensified political fire\u201d should it stay on the sidelines.\u201cProposed FX intervention would put the Fed in a really difficult place,\u201d Sheets said. \u201cOne approach would be to let the Treasury go alone, but for the chairman, in parallel, to provide supportive commentary, emphasizing that Treasury takes the lead on currency policy.\u201d","category":"business"},{"title":"Billionaire Azim Premji helps create India\u2019s newest tech unicorn","article":"Billionaire Azim Premji has helped create India\u2019s latest tech unicorn: a fast-rising software startup that symbolizes the growing investor interest in the Asian nation\u2019s enterprise technology space.Icertis, which competes with SAP SE and Oracle Corp. to help businesses manage contracts in the cloud, has raised $115 million, propelling it to unicorn status as investors flock to enterprise software makers.The advanced-stage funding round in Bellevue, Washington and Pune, India-based Icertis was co-led by Greycroft Partners LLC and PremjiInvest, the fund managed by the family office of Indian tech billionaire Premji.

According to the current tax laws, if your \u2018taxable\u2019 salary is Rs 2.5 lakh or lesser, you don\u2019t have to pay any taxes; and if your taxable salary is Rs 5 lakh, your tax liability will become Rs12,500 and you can earn full rebate on that amount. In the interim budget, the then finance minister had increased the rebate amount from the erstwhile Rs 2,500. However, you should note that this is not an exemption and you will still have to file your returns. The tax slab on income above Rs 2.5 lakh continues for those who earn above Rs 5 lakh. For instance, if your taxable income is Rs 6.5 lakh, you still have to pay tax on the Rs 2.5 lakh and Rs 5 lakh slab of 5%. However, you can avoid paying tax in case you invest your money in certain investment instruments. Say your taxable salary is Rs 8.5 lakh and the total tax payable on it is Rs 85,800 including 4% cess. If you bring your taxable income below Rs 5 lakh from Rs 8.5 lakh, you can avoid paying tax. Here is how: If you invest in areas which are allowed for tax deduction, you can reduce your taxable income to Rs 5 lakh. \u201cThe deductions allowed are as follows under various sections. Section 80C - up to Rs 1.5 lakh ( PF, PPF, life insurance premium, tuition fee for two children, principal repayment of home loan, Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana, Tax saver FD), Section 80D \u2013 up to Rs 25,000 towards health insurance premium paid for family, Section 80D \u2013 up to Rs 25,000 towards health insurance premium paid for parents (This is Rs 50,000 if parents are above 60 years), section 80CCD (1B) - up to Rs 50,000 invested in NPS and Section 24 \u2013 up to Rs 2 lakh for the interest paid on home loan,\u201d said Melvin Joseph, founder of Navi Mumabi-based FinVin Financial Planners. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.defineSlot('\/1055314\/HT_Desk_In-story_Top_728x90', [[728, 90],[1, 1]], 'div-gpt-ad-1536739653096-0').addService(googletag.pubads()).setCollapseEmptyDiv(true,true); googletag.pubads().enableSingleRequest(); googletag.enableServices(); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1536739653096-0'); }); If you do not find these above sections relevant, you can further claim tax deductions in other sections. \u201cYou can claim house rent allowance (HRA), however, the deduction for HRA cannot exceed: 50% of your basic salary for metro cities and 40% for non-metro cities, provided your monthly rent amount is 10% more than your basic salary; leave travel allowance but this is allowed twice in a block of four years for self and family members for amount spent on fare,\u201d said Ashok Shah, partner, NA Shah Associates LLP. You can invest in these areas to reduce your taxable income to Rs 5 lakh. \u201cIf you can show Rs 3.5 lakh in total under these heads, your taxable income will be Rs 5 lakh and tax liability will be Rs 12,500.

The government has come up with a draft tenancy law for you and your landlord. So far you must have noticed the focus on buying a property or on home loans from the government. In this Budget, the finance minister spoke about tenancy law, post which the government has proposed a Model Tenancy Law to regulate renting of premises. \u201cThis is not the first time. There have been archaic laws relating to this space. States have their own Rent Control Acts, which are old and not really serving the true purpose,\u201d said Ramesh Nair, chief executive officer and country head, JLL India.The draft tenancy lawAccording to the new draft Model Tenancy Act, 2019, security deposit has been capped to a maximum of two months\u2019 rent in case of residential property, and a minimum of one month\u2019s rent in the case of non-residential property. The draft imposes penalty for failure to vacate a residential unit. The landlord is entitled to get a compensation of double the monthly rent for two months and four times of the monthly rent thereafter if a tenant does not vacate the premises after tenancy has been terminated by order, notice or as per agreement. Also, the landlord cannot hike the rents in the middle of the tenure.A landlord cannot cut off or withhold essential supplies or services such as electricity and water under the new Act. The property owner must give prior notice of three months before revising the rent value.The tenant cannot sublet a part of or the whole property to someone else. The draft also makes it the landlord\u2019s responsibility to rectify structural damages and undertake measures like whitewashing walls and painting doors and windows. \u201cWith nearly 30% of households in urban areas staying in rented accommodation, this regulation will have a significant impact on the rental market. The law, if implemented, will have rules for both residential and non-residential premises. It is early to comment on actual implementation process,\u201d said Nair. What does it mean for you?At first look, the draft rules seem to be favourable for both tenants and landlords. \u201cHowever, there are some inherent challenges. The cap on the security deposit can become a pain-point for many landlords in cities such as Bengaluru \u2014a 10-month security deposit (with some scope for negotiation) was the accepted norm. Also, if a tenant defaults or causes significant damage to a property, a two-month security deposit may not cover the expenses the property owner incurs in repairs. While the government lays down the basic policies, the exact rules will likely change within each state since land is a state subject. Like we saw in the highly lopsided roll-out of RERA, the Model Tenancy Act, 2019 may lose its real purpose if states do not follow the basic guidelines and dilute them,\u201d said Anuj Puri, chairman, Anarock Property Consultants. According to Puri, the Model Tenancy Act, 2019 - like RERA - may well become a process rather than an event, and need several course corrections to reduce regional dilutions before it becomes a force to reckon with. 7 things you should know about tenancy law\u2022Written tenancy agreement to be submitted with the Rent Authority- within two months\u2022Submission in electronic form will make the process easier and efficient. Security deposit capped at two months\u2019 rent in case of residential property and minimum of one month\u2019s rent in case of non-residential property\u2022Prior consent of the landlord required for sub-letting whole or part of the premises held by tenant.

Yet the brewer should take at least someresponsibility. This concoction was far too frothy for investors when Asian economies face an array of sobering realities.AB InBevsaidit will no longer proceedwith theIPO of its Asia-Pacific business, Budweiser Brewing Company APAC Ltd., which had been aiming to raise as much as $9.8 billion in Hong Kong. The company\u2019s American depositary receipts fell as much as 4.9% in New York before closing down 3% on Friday.The offeringvalued Budweiser Brewing between 15.5 times and 18.2 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization \u2013well above the multiples for Carlsberg A\/S and Heineken NV, and a premium to shares of the parent. The price range of HK$40 to HK$47 ($5.11to $6.01) a share would have resulted in a market capitalization of $54.2 billion to $63.7 billion.You can hardly blame investors for wanting to sit this one out. The U.S.-China trade war is at an impasseand the ripples are widening.Singapore, a bellwether for global trade, on Friday posted its sharpest growth declinesince 2012. While the Federal Reservehas signaledthat interest rate cuts are coming, which has buoyed U.S. stocks, that\u2019s also drivinga wedge between the world\u2019s biggest economy and the rest. This split is perhaps nowhere more apparent than theIPO market. Listings in the U.S. are on track for their best year since 2014. Hong Kong, the top destinationlast year, is languishing by comparison, after a series of high-profile bloopersincluding smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. in July 2018 and food-delivery giant Meituan Dianping in September. As I\u2019ve argued, reclaiming that crown will be an uphill battle; and now Hong Kong is facing competition from Shanghai fortech IPOs. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.\u2019s secondary listingplan is a ray of light \u2013but this latest kerfuffle could dim any optimism.Against this dismal backdrop, it\u2019s little wonder things went south. Yet it\u2019s a mistake to overlook AB InBev\u2019s ownmissteps. For one thing, the company marketed itself as a purveyor of high-end beer, taking cues from Chinese consumers\u2019 growing taste for foreign brands and craft labels. Perhaps its price range doesn\u2019t look so out of whack when you consider the country\u2019s brewers tradeanywhere between 15 times and 21 times, according to Bloomberg data. Yet investors just weren\u2019t convinced that demand would hold up in a slowing economy. The company\u2019s China pitch also ignoredmature markets likeSouth Korea and Australia, whichmake up around half of Budweiser Brewing\u2019s Ebitda, according to Bernstein Research.Then there\u2019s the fact that growing a brandin Asia\u2019s fragmented market is easier said than done. India, where whiskey is the traditional tipple of choice, and Southeast Asia could have been fertile ground for expansion. One argument for an Asia IPOwas thatBudweiser Brewing would benefit from local tie-ups. WouldtheThai tycoon who ownsVietnam\u2019s top brewer, Sabeco Trading Corp.,or the magnate that controls the Philippines\u2019 San Miguel Corp.really cede control to the Belgian brewer for a piece of the Hong Kong listing? I\u2019m unconvinced. The fatal flaw, however,may have been AB InBev\u2019s hubris. In deciding against a cornerstone investor tranche, the company eschewed a fixture of Hong Kong\u2019s IPO market. It turns out investors really do like the comfort of big names that pledge to hold stock \u2013even if the practice ties up a lot of liquidity. Had Budweiser\u2019s listing succeeded, it would have been a win for market reform, too.With such a bubblyvaluation, AB InBev may have thought its investors were wearing beer goggles.

One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. This month, banks including ICICI Bank Ltd, Bank of Baroda and Oriental Bank of Commerce, have cut their MCLR by 5-10 bps. The move comes after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cut policy rate for the third time in June. Here is what it means for you:Home loan rates will not fall immediatelyIf you are an existing home loan borrower, a cut of 5-10 bps on MCLR will not bring down your home loan interest rate immediately. If you have a floating rate home loan and your loan is linked your MCLR, you will have a reset clause linked to the tenure of the MCLR. For instance, if your loan is linked to one-year MCLR, you will have a one-year reset clause. Now, if the reset clause is in May and the MCLR cut happened in July, your home loan will not change till next May. If your loan has a reset clause of July or August, you will see a fall in your home loan rate. Also, your equated monthly instalment (EMI) will not go down as banks usually adjust the tenure of the loan instead of the EMI.Some relief for new borrowersIf you are about to take a floating rate home loan, you are set to get relief. Banks have cut interest rate marginally. Considering that it is a falling interest rate environment, you will get a better interest rate than the last couple of months. However, it is difficult to predict whether you should wait and watch for another rate cut before taking a loan. New borrowers should instead compare home loan rates across financial institutions before taking a loan. Usually, home loans come with a spread on MCLR. Try opting for loans that are on MCLR without spread.Opt for alternative floating rate option.You now also have the option to go for loans linked to repo rate or other external benchmark rates instead of MCLR for floating rate loans. For instance, SBI this month launched a floating rate linked to the repo rate. The rate has a margin and a spread making it 10bps cheaper than MCLR. In these loans, your interest rate will fluctuate in case of any change in repo rate. In the case of MCLR, the impact of change in repo rate comes with a lag considering the banks also have to evaluate their cost of funds.Avoid fixed rate home loansIn the current interest rate environment, you should avoid opting for fixed-rate loans. Fixed rate home loans are usually fixed for a certain duration of the loan. Considering that the interest rate is falling, it is possible that you may get locked into a higher interest rate for your home loan and getting out of it will be expensive since you have to pay a higher penalty to switch loans from fixed to floating.","category":"business"},{"title":"Three loans you must avoid","article":"With easy access to credit in the digital-savvy world, you can now get loans at a click of a button on your smartphone.However, taking loans is not always a smart idea. In the financial world, loans are classified into good credit and bad credit. If you are taking a loan to build an asset such as a house or for your education, it is considered as a good loan. However, loans taken to fulfil your lifestyle needs such as paying your food bills or for buying gadgets are considered as bad loans. Here are three loans you must avoid:Loans to buy food and clothesFinancial institutions now provide loans to pay for your food bills and even to buy clothes. For instance, if you order food through an online app you have an option to differ the payment and pay the total amount at a certain date of the month.These are small ticket loans which would look small in absolute terms. You get a grace period of around 15 days. If you cross the due date, you will be either charged a flat fee of ?250 as a penalty or 3% a month for the days the amount stays overdue on a pro rata basis. Loans to buy household goodsIf you don\u2019t have money to buy furniture or white goods, it would be better to hold the purchases. nstead of buying your air conditioner, microwave and sofa on loan, you should instead save the amount every month to build the corpus required to buy it. Most financial institutions provide an equated monthly instalment option.Some may offer an interest-free loan, however, you still end up spending more money in the form or a flat fee as processing charge or one-time fee. Financial institutions that offer consumer durable loans may also charge an interest in the range of 12-24% per annum.Loans to pay off loans. Companies lending loans say that most individuals take loans to pay off loans that they already have taken. It is not advisable to take too many loans as you are likely to get into a debt trap. However, in situations where you have to pay off a loan with a higher interest rate, you may want to opt for a cheaper loan.For instance, say you have a credit card loan on which you pay an interest rate of 48% per annum. You can consider a personal loan of 12-18% per annum to pay of the credit card loan and minimise your outgo. However, remember that non-repayment of debt can have a negative impact on your credit report and credit score.","category":"business"},{"title":"Rain-check for insurance covers","article":"Monsoons have almost reached the length and breadth of the country. When you think of monsoon, you most probably think of a new umbrella or a hot cup of tea. It is rare that you would think of insurance covers. Monsoon may bring a sense of hope, but it comes with its own set of perils \u2014 diseases and damages \u2014 that you should be covered for. Let\u2019s have a look at what\u2019s on offer mostly and what you should go for.Disease-specific coversThere are many health issues that may come up during the monsoon seasons \u2014 dengue, malaria, cholera among others.While there are disease-specific covers such as dengue insurance cover that will cover only one particular illness, there are some comprehensive health insurance plans that cover most of these mosquito-borne diseases.For example, Apollo Munich Health Insurance has a Dengue Care plan that covers your dengue-related expenses. \u201cThis plan offers coverage against expenses arising from hospitalisation whether in-patient or outpatient treatment. It has no age limitations,\u201d said Naval Goel, founder, Policyx.com, an insurance web aggregato You will also find plans such as Future Generali Insurance Co Ltd\u2019s Vector Care plan that covers you for all the vector-borne diseases.\u201cThe plan offers a lump sum benefit in case the insured is diagnosed and hospitalised owing to serious diseases caused by vectors. The plan is available for an infant of 1 day to a 65-year-old person. It is liable to offer coverage against \u2013malaria, dengue, lymphatic filariasis, kala-azar, Japanese encephalitis, chikungunya and zika virus,\u201d said Goel.However, experts will still prefer that you go for a comprehensive health cover. \u201cYou should always have a comprehensive base health cover and then top it up with critical illness and personal accident cover,\u201d said Suresh Sadagopan, founder, Ladder7 Financial Advisories. These disease-specific covers should never replace your basic health cover. \u201cIf you think you need such covers, these should be as add-ons only and should not become the base cover in itself,\u201d added Ankit Agrawal, CEO and co-founder, Insurancedekho, an insurance web aggregatorHeavy rain also gives way to sloppy road constructions and accidents. \u201cThere is a higher chance of an accident during monsoon season so a personal accident cover is also required,\u201d said Goel. A personal accident insurance plan covers you against disability and death arising out of an accident. It covers you against loss of life and limbs, disablement, loss of eyesight and likewise.\u201cTo protect your vehicle against heavy rain and floods, you must buy a comprehensive plan which carries the mandated third-party cover along with the damages to your own car. In the comprehensive cover, you might also want to add additional benefits such as zero depreciation policy and engine cover (useful for flood-prone areas),\u201d said Goel.Add on covers such as engine cover, which protects the engine of your vehicle from water damage and zero depreciation policy, helps you in getting the entire claim amount and not a depreciated one in case of any calamity like flooding and likewise.\u201cApart from these two covers, a road assistance add-on cover may also help you during heavy rain in getting coverage for towing your vehicle,\u201d said Agrawal. Such covers are required if you travel by road to work every day and live in areas which are affected by heavy rain on a regular basis.\u201cThe engine cover add-on might increase your premiums by 15 to 20%, but it is highly recommended for those of you who live in cities such as Mumbai, Pune and Bengaluru,\u201d Agrawal added.Home InsuranceProperty insurance or home insurancewill help in case the structure or its contents are damaged owing to flooding, inundation, storm, cloud burst and lightning.\u201cYou should go for comprehensive home insurance cover instead of limiting it to just fire and theft. Some insurance companies do not offer coverage against rainwater damages under home insurance,\u201d said Goel. Bajaj Allianz\u2019s My Home Insurance Policy offers overage to your home and\/ or its contents to stay protected from risks of losses or damages, that may be caused to them by any unforeseen events including monsoons, while Smart householder\u2019s package policy by Bharti AXA General Insurance does not, according to Agrawal.What should you do? \u201cMonsoon is just a trigger,\u201d says Sadagopan. Most of these insurance covers are always on the must-have list of advisors. It is not a new or a monsoonspecific idea that the aforementioned covers are necessary. Monsoons and such untoward incidents is just a trigger to check your comprehensive insurance coverage. Experts suggest that you should have a regular comprehensive health cover at all times, which will cover you for more illnesses, and not just a single illness.

Varun revealed that he is working on Street Dancer 3D despite fever but clearly his dad is the winner when it comes to work ethics.Wearing casuals, David is seen sitting on a sofa and Varun holds his camera, signalling \u2018action\u2019 to his dad. David then goes on to explain how he worked in double shifts - a 9am to 5pm and another one from 8pm to 4am. He talks in detail about shuttling between the location and hotel in Ooty. Sharing the video, Varun wrote, \u201cMy dads schedule for his film vs my schedule. Even with fever while I shoot and think today was a hard day on the sets of #sd3. This is only till my dad told me how he used to shoot a double shift going up to nearly 19 or 20 hrs a day sometimes. Those days the unions where not strong enough for technicians and films needed to be made in this manner.i want to always be the hardest worker in the room and I still have alot of catching up to do to earn that place in my home. #lovefilms. Varun worked with his dad in Main Tera Hero and Judwaa 2; they will soon begin work on Coolie No 1 sequel. Talking about his dad, Varun recently told Hindustan Times, \u201cThe way he faces adversity. He has faced a lot of ups and downs but the way he has come back... after every failure, he has come back stronger. I remember in 2000s, his career had a bad dip and almost three of his films didn\u2019t work in a row and he was written off. But, then he came back with a massive hit in Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2014). He has never waited for big stars. He made Chashme Baddoor (2013), which was such a big hit. I wish I had that quality. I don\u2019t want to only wait for big directors. I want to be able to do well with new directors and with directors whose previous films haven\u2019t done well.\u201d Talking about working in a Coolie No 1 sequel, he added, \u201cI feel pressure with every film, not just in dad\u2019s films. The screenplay of Coolie No 1 is outstanding. The film is coming back after 25 years. The premise has changed but the essence remains the same. I wanted to do the film because of the story and screenplay. It is going to be fun working with Sara (Ali Khan) and also Paresh Rawal.\u201d","category":"entertainment"},{"title":"Sushmita Sen gets a kiss from boyfriend Rohman Shawl who can\u2019t enough of her dimples, she replies \u2018all yours\u2019","article":"Actor Sushmita Sen is enjoying the company of her boyfriend Rohman Shawls and often shares their adorable pictures and videos on Instagram.

On this occasion, we take a look at ten most memorable performances of the star from his over two-decade-long career to understand what sets him apart from his contemporaries. NandhaOne of Suriya\u2019s earliest success as a star came via Nandha, which was directed by Bala. The story was centered on the journey of a young man from a juvenile jail coming back to the society and trying to fit in. Playing a role with hardly any dialogues, the film showcased Suriya\u2019s versatility as an actor. In an interview post release, Suriya said Nandha made him a serious actor and that Bala instilled in him the discipline to work without committing errors.Kaakha KaakhaThe film marked Suriya\u2019s maiden collaboration with filmmaker Gautham Vasudev Menon. It wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say Kaaka Kaakha, one of Suriya\u2019s best action roles, redefined the portrayal of police in mainstream cinema. Playing a suave IPS officer with crew cut and ripped body, the film saw Suriya deliver a very realistic performance as young police officer Anbuselvan. In his second collaboration with filmmaker Bala in Pithamagan, Suriya was seen playing a conman with a silver tongue. While most would argue that the film belonged to Vikram as he went on to fetch a national award for his performance, Suriya was equally good in a much underrated role. Aayutha EzhuthuA fiery Suriya was a treat to watch in Mani Ratnam\u2019s Aayutha Ezhuthu, playing a straight headed student leader who locks horns with a local leader. The film might have garnered mixed response at the box-office but it sure brought out a different dimension in Suriya\u2019s acting.GhajiniAR Murugadoss\u2019s Ghajini, loosely based on Christopher Nolan\u2019s Memento, was one of the biggest blockbusters in Suriya\u2019s career. Playing a character suffering from short term memory loss, Suriya sets out to avenge the death of his girlfriend in this action drama. Suriya spent months in the gym to build his body for his role in the film which was a bigger hit in Telugu as well.Vaaranam Aayiram In his second collaboration with Gautham Menon, Suriya played dual roles as father and son in this coming of age drama of a young man whose life undergoes a transition after heartbreak. Inspired by Menon\u2019s own relationship with his father, the film featured a heartwarming father-son relationship sub-plot featuring Suriya. If you\u2019re a sucker for romance, then you\u2019ve got to fall in love with the scenes between Suriya and Sameera Reddy. SingamSingam was Suriya\u2019s big leap as a commercial hero and the film\u2019s success was unprecedented. As a duty fearing cop from a small village, it was refreshing to see Suriya don the khaki in a role that was loud but at the same time entertaining to the core. Sporting a handlebar moustache, Suriya brought a desi twist to the policeman avatar and it worked wonders with the masses.Also read: Ranveer Singh captures his entire career in 10 selfies, with a bonus pic of his real self. Which one do you prefer?Rakht Charitra In what could be described as the most underrated performance in Suriya\u2019s career, his role as Suri in Ram Gopal Varma\u2019s Rakht Charitra needs to be discussed more often and not just on special occasions. Inspired from the events that took place in the life of former gangster turned politician Paritala Ravi; Suriya teamed up with RGV for the first time and the result was unbelievably good. One could literally feel Suri\u2019s vengeance through his eyes, such was the impact of the KV Anand\u2019s Maattrraan may not have been as successful as the filmmaker\u2019s previous collaboration with Suriya but the film is remembered even today for its novel concept of making its hero play conjoined twins and Suriya couldn\u2019t have done better justice. It takes guts to attempt something as outlandish as playing conjoined twins in mainstream cinema but Suriya made it work. Here\u2019s another Suriya starrer that deserved more love than what it received. A truly path breaking attempt, the film, a time-travel thriller, saw Suriya in triple roles and nailing each one with grace. As the antagonist Athreya, Suriya was unapologetically menacing and his performance was worth every buck spent on the film.","category":"entertainment"},{"title":"Anu Malik set to return to television after being fired from Indian Idol over MeToo allegations","article":"Music director Anu Malik is reportedly set to make a comeback on television.

Here\u2019s some help","article":"Marvel Studios announced its next slate of superheroes at the San Diego Comin-Con last weekend, leaving fans all around the world exhilarated at the new possibilities. Phase Four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) will include 10 movies and Disney+ series when it launches next year.Among the movies announced were the long awaited Black Widow solo movie, a fourth instalment in the Thor series, second film in Doctor Strange series and more. While these are characters that we have already met in the previous 23 films from the MCU, there were quite a few new names taken. Among those were the Eternals, Blade and Shang-Chi and even, a female Thor!So if you have been wanting a small introduction to these new superheroes, we have got you covered:Eternals. Salma Hayek, from left, Lia McHugh, Don Lee and Angelina Jolie participate in the Marvel Studios panel on day three of Comic-Con.The film stars Angelina Jolie as Thena, Salma Hayek as Ajax, along with Game Of Thrones fame Richard Madden as Ikarus, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry, Lia McHugh, and Don Lee. Chloe Zhao is directing the film. In the comics, Eternals are shown as physically similar to normal human beings but with powerful abilities. They have super strength, flight, teleportation, mind control, shape-shifting and energy projection. They were created from alien experiments on ancient humans millions of years ago. They lived in space cities and defended Earth from threats, like the Deviants, another race of super-humans that was more destructive and deformed.There are a few dozen Eternals in the comics, but the movie is said to focus on two of the most prominent ones named Sersi and Ikaris.Shang-ChiDestin Daniel Cretton, left, and Simu Liu speaks during the Shang-Chi and The Legend of the Ten Rings portion of the Marvel Studios panel on day three of Comic-Con. Thor: Love and Thunder is slated for November 5, 2021, release. Natalie Portman will reprise her role as Jane Foster. She will become the first female Thor in the MCU. Taika Waititi will direct the movie. During one of Thor comic\u2019s many storylines, Nick Fury says something to Thor that makes him lose his worthiness to lift the Mjolnir. Later, a woman lifts the hammer, proving her worthiness and fighting against the evil. While Thor tries hard to learn of her identity and win back his hammer at first, he later gives up the fight. He also relinquishes the name and role of Thor and is henceforth simply called Odinson. Meanwhile, Jane is suffering from cancer in real life so Thor doesn\u2019t doubt that she could be the female Thor. However, turning into Thor is the only time when the cancer and chemotherapy have no effect on her.","category":"entertainment"},{"title":"Akshay Kumar: \u2018Most of my films have women\u2019s empowerment, but I\u2019ve to do a Housefull, a Rowdy Rathore also\u2019","article":"He is 51, but age clearly doesn\u2019t deter Akshay Kumar from pushing the envelope. Possibly in the best phase of his career, the actor wants to thank people, including the media, for \u201ccriticising me to a point that it brought the best out of me\u201d. With films such as Mission Mangal, Housefull 4, Good News, Sooryavanshi and Laxmmi Bomb releasing one after the other, he explains why he isn\u2019t restricting himself to any one genre and wants \u201cto have all kinds of films in my kitty\u201d. In an interview, Akshay shares what his experience taught him, his take on female co-stars, his films releasing globally and why he hasn\u2019t done a Hollywood film, yet.Akshay Kumar, Vidya Balan, Taapsee Pannu, Sonakshi Sinha, Nithya Menen and Kirti Kulhari during the trailer launch of Mission Mangal in Mumbai, Thursday, July 18. Your films not only inspire but entertain, too. Is that the sole mission as an actor? Most of my films be it Padman (2018), Toilet: Ek Prem Katha (2017) or even (the upcoming) Mission Mangal, they have one more thing \u2014 women\u2019s empowerment. But I\u2019ve to do a Housefull, a Rowdy Rathore and a Good News also. So, it\u2019s not that this [issue-based films] is the only thing I do. Whenever I get a chance and a good script, I\u2019ll do it. I want to have all kinds of films in my kitty.Your upcoming films belong to different genres. Is it exciting to juggle so many different roles? All these things have been taught to me by my own experience. I\u2019ve learned that if I do different genres, I won\u2019t be tagged. When I used to do a lot of action, everyone said, \u2018He is an action hero and nothing else\u2019. So, I tried comedy, and then everyone was talking about just that. Then I decided I\u2019ve to do different kinds of films. So, I am thankful to people, and the media, for criticising me to that point and bringing out the best in me.In terms of female co-stars, you\u2019ve worked with leading heroines as well as fresh faces. How do you strike that balance? It doesn\u2019t really matter because what\u2019s important is that the person has to suit the role. It\u2019s not about how big the actor is. And not just female co-stars, it applies to the male actors, too. A lot of times I\u2019ve lost roles. Though I thought I\u2019d be very good (for those roles), the makers felt I won\u2019t be able to perform. When I signed Toilet..., I was told I wouldn\u2019t be able to carry it off. But I took it as a challenge and said, \u2018let me try\u2019. Also, there were times when I myself didn\u2019t feel I fit the part, and backed off. Does that give a sense of contentment? It\u2019s great to see our films being accepted globally. I hope doors are opened in all countries. There are many brilliant films that should go all over the world. I personally feel what Indian cinema is doing, and the kind of scripts it\u2019s bringing on to the screen, even Hollywood is not doing such kind of work.Why haven\u2019t we seen you take up a Hollywood film yet? I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019ve not been offered Hollywood films, but whatever came wasn\u2019t big enough or that great. And I\u2019m very happy doing films here [in Bollywood]. If something very good and effective comes that lets me show my talent in a better way, I would love to do it.Does your family, especially your wife Twinkle Khanna, play a crucial role in your choice of films? Yes, my wife has been a very big help in my career. It\u2019s not that I have to discuss every script with her before I give it my nod, but she talks to me and I remember [those] things. She told me once, \u2018Koi zor zabardasti nahi hai, jo achha lage karo\u2019.","category":"entertainment"},{"title":"Arjun Rampal shares an adorable picture with his newborn son as he holds his hand for the first time.

I was sleeping on the platform, I had no money,\u201d says Anupam Kher who is all set to release his autobiography next month. The veteran actor hopes that his autobiography, like the one by his idol (Charlie Chaplin), inspire people to take that leap of faith with conviction to realise their dreams. The title, Lessons Life Taught Me Unknowingly, set to release on August 5, will give readers an insight into his life from the time he was a young boy to today, a veteran movie legend, with almost four decades of experience under his belt. Excerpts from an interviewYou had said in an interview, \u201cThis book is about my failures and not my successes,\u201d which is a very apt way to describe one\u2019s autobiography... I had written a book before, The Best Thing about You Is You. It was more of a life coaching book. This one is an autobiography. But this is not about a life of an actor. This is an autobiography of a person who has lived life and has learnt lots of things. It is about the journey of a small town clerk\u2019s son and the lessons life taught him. I remember when the publishing house approached me. Back then, I was going through a rough phase in my life. I was suffering from facial paralysis and I had almost gone bankrupt. The catch is that the world does not perceive you that way, it does not see that. The world feels everyone who is talked about and written about is successful. At that time, I said I was not a writer, they said tape it. But when I recorded for around 10-12 hours of voice notes, and listened, I realised that I only talked about what went wrong in my life. And some of them are really funny, when I look back at them. What was the writing process like? I started writing my autobiography at the age of 10. That makes for the opening line of the book, too. When you revisit your life, it gives you very mixed feelings. There is a very good line in my film, Daddy (1989), \u2018yaad karne par, beeta hua sukh bhi dukh hi deta hai\u2019. It is true because you are remembering your childhood, your struggles and it is sweet yet painful. Nostalgia is painful. There have been times when I am in New York, and I smell something on the streets and I remember my childhood. When you are from a poor family, you are driven to do something great in life. I have been performing my life story on stage for so many years, that I noticed there are so many minute intricacies which will look good in a book. So when I started writing, I first got my play translated into English. But that was nothing compared to what I wanted to write. I wanted to describe the smell of the mud of my land, the visuals of the snow clad mountains where I lived, the feel of being a lower middle class and my poor Hindi school. All this cannot happen in a play or a film. But in a book, it can be captured. So, the process involved taping conversations with myself and transcribing it. Then I started giving it a form. But yes, even today, when I read it, it feels like there are so many things that I\u2019ve left out.Then, how do you decide what to incorporate and what to let go? So, three years ago when I decided the title of my book, it gave me new found focus. So, the title told me what to add what to miss. I have always wanted my life to be inspirational. Because when I was a struggling actor, I used to read autobiographies of people to deal with life and the hardships. But my book is more about the way I have conducted life and the way I have not let failures bother me. There are so many people in the world who want to make it, who don\u2019t have godfathers, and all they need is the right attitude. So, I hope my book can become the means for them to gain that confidence. If one watches your interviews, you come across as a very confident artiste. Were you a confident writer as well? I come across as confident and powerful because I speak the truth, no matter how comfortable or uncomfortable it is for me or the other person. My grandfather used to say, \u2018if you are telling the truth, then you don\u2019t have to remember it\u2019. Also, it comes from the fact that I gained a lot of emotional strength because I lived in a joint family. Even though we were poor, I was emotionally secure. But I have to say, as a writer, no, I was not confident. But I know that I was sincere. But I must add that I did not want to hurt anybody either. But if it is the truth, then you may have to ruffle a few feathers\u2026 No, my truth cannot hurt anybody. I will have to camouflage it. In fact, I have done that with my play, too.

In an order passed on July 6, Andheri Metropolitan Court Magistrate Ketaki Chavan also directed Mitra to pay a compensation of Rs 4.64 lakh to model Poonam Sethi, the complainant in the case.The court was hearing a 2013 case, as per which Mitra borrowed Rs 22 lakh from Sethi over a period of time, but failed to return the entire amount. As per the court order, Mitra issued a cheque of Rs 3 lakh to Sethi to repay a loan, but it was dishonoured by the bank.On July 19, 2013, Sethi issued a legal notice to Mitra over the dishonoured cheque.

Her lawyer also alleged that Sethi ran an illegal money lending business.

With a clear 70s gangsta vibe, the photo misses out on two fan favourites though \u2013 Scared Games season 1\u2019s Kuckoo (Kubbra Sait), Anjali Mathur (Radhika Apte) and Constable Katekar (Jitendra Joshi). In a proof that the cops and gangsters of Scared Games clean up nice, the entire cast left their gritty on-screen personas for edgy and ultra-glam avatars. The looks were styled by Tanya Ghavri and Mohit Rai. Says Ghavri, \u201cWe handpicked pieces from various designers, high-street labels, and the actors\u2019 personal vintage collections, and the final ensembles channeled the decade\u2019s anti-conformist, chic approach to fashion.\u201d The shoot was captured by Rohan Shreshtha.Talking about the upcoming show, Saif Ali Khan \u2013 Sacred Games\u2019 Sartaj Singh \u2013 said, \u201cSacred Games Season 2 has been a very creative experience with some bright people putting their best foot forward, being as intelligent as they can, being as artistic as they can, and that\u2019s not an environment that you find every day. It pretty much picks up from where the season 1 ends. While season 1 set the stage, this season develops it further, and deals more with the inner workings of Sartaj\u2019s mind, personality, background, family, and father. It\u2019s a logical progression; there\u2019s a little more action, there\u2019s a little more speed and drama, and it\u2019s also when the whole sacred angle comes in.\u201d Ganesh Gaitonde aka Nawazuddin Siddiqui also spoke about what the audience can expect in the upcoming season, \u201cIn the first season, the challenge was dealing with the situations that I faced as an actor, because I wasn\u2019t aware of what my journey would be like in the second season. The situations my character faces in both seasons are different, so we had to keep adapting accordingly. Of course, we try to put our best foot forward always. In this season, the way Ganesh Gaitonde talks and walks will remain the same, but the change in his surroundings will bring about an internal change in him.\u201d Pankaj Tripathi\u2019s Guruji is expected to play a big role in the new season. Talking about how he will be a game-changer, the actor said, \u201cGuruji is a well-read man, he has his own style of thinking, and much like many others, he too feels that his beliefs and thoughts are superior to others, and that his approach to life is the correct one.\u201d Kalki Koechlin, who enters the show as Batya in season 2, was seen with Guruji in Sacred Games 2 trailer. \u201cBatya is from a very conflicting background; her father is Jewish French and her mother is Palestinian, who had abandoned her as a teenager. You will see Batya\u2019s journey of transforming from a rebellious, angry teenager with a drug addiction to this very calm woman over the years, once she reaches Guruji\u2019s Ashram,\u201d she said. Surveen Chawla, who played Jojo for a fleeting scene in Sacred Games, has a more well defined role in this one. \u201cJojo is somebody who\u2019s not afraid of Gaitonde--she is just amazing. And in season 2, I think you\u2019re going to find out why. She has a tremendous impact on Gaitonde\u2019s life in every way,\u201d Surveen said.Jatin Sarna, who plays the fan favourite Bunty in the show, said, \u201cThe second season will showcase a very different side of Bunty, one which you\u2019ve not seen in season 1. You will have to wait and watch season 2, as there are many exciting things in store for the viewers.\u201d If the motivations of Luke Kenny\u2019s Malcolm intrigued you in season 1, expect the answers this time round. \u201cIn Season 2, we find out a lot more about Malcolm--who he is, where he comes from, and how he is connected to all this.

The 32-year-old was crowned the latest global golf star after leaving the field way behind, winning the British Open by six shots at the Royal Portrush Golf Club in Northern Ireland on Sunday.Lowry\u2019s triumph wiped out past frustration, especially a meltdown in the 2016 US Open after going into the final round four shots ahead. It left questions of another nearly man hanging over the affable Lowry, who one report said was the first bearded winner of the year\u2019s final Major in well over a century!Lowry was being hailed as a great champion for the way in which he dealt with the pressure of staying ahead, after going into Sunday\u2019s final round four shots ahead of England\u2019s Tommy Fleetwood. He finished with a one-over 72 in the final round to ensure there would not be a second meltdown, and rather he won\u2019t let any of his great rivals come anywhere near.Links courses are tough to tackle and demand a conservative approach, but Lowry, who learnt his first golf lessons on his own, choose to follow his mantra. \u201cProfessional golf is all about just ticking along and taking your birdies when you can. If you can make four or five birdies a day and try and limit your mistakes you\u2019re going to be up there at the end of the week,\u201d said Lowry.Nothing tests a golfer more than the kind of course on which The Open is played. The links course is fundamentally different from the tree-lined and minutely designed modern courses that dot the calendar on the PGA Tour. And that is why some of the finest golfers of the world struggled as rain and wind made life difficult.To start with, the word \u2018links\u2019 is derived from the Old English word \u2018hlinc\u2019, with Scottish root. It means rising ground with ridges on the coast and is characterised by undulating surface and sand dunes. While the land by the ocean is not suited for cultivation, a sort of fescue grass does grow on it.Typically the links course is quite barren\u2014there is no tree for shelter from wind or rain, both major challenges for the players who need to factor in the shifting weather even during the course of a round, leave alone the tournament. The open course leaves golfers at the mercy of the weather, thus placing a demand on their skills that are way different from playing on designer courses. Apart from finding their tee shots veering off course due to strong winds, the firm fairways due to the hard turf means the golfers can\u2019t attack the green and instead must land the ball short and let it run on to the putting surface. Water hazards too are rare on links courses whose distinct feature is also the deep \u2018pot bunkers\u2019. Due to the wind factor, lower flight of the ball is key while the greens are slower to prevent the ball from moving. The British Open has always been held on a coastal links course in England, Scotland or Northern Ireland. Links golf is considered the purest form of the game where the course is shaped by nature rather than \u2018built\u2019 or designed.","category":"sport"},{"title":"India vs West Indies:?Pollard, Narine named in 14-man squad for first two T20Is","article":"Kieron Pollard and Sunil Narine made a comeback into the West Indies side as selectors named a 14-member squad for the first two T20Is against India on Monday.

Her 13-year-long shooting career has endured gun malfunction to misfiring to poor scores in the German city. For Rahi, anything and everything can go wrong when it comes to the Munich range.To make matters worse, Rahi was struggling to translate her high practice scores into competitions when the ISSF Munich World Cup came calling in May. In the two previous World Cups, in Delhi and Beijing, she had finished 15th (580) and 26th (579), respectively, in qualification. The quota in 25m sports pistol for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics looked a distant dream. That\u2019s when Rahi and her coach Munkhbayar Dorjsuren decided to give it their all in the year\u2019s third World Cup and nail the Olympics quota in Munich itself. It was also a way to heal her mental scars.\u201cWe especially chose the Munich range to get the quota place as it is the home range of my coach. My training was going very well but it was just not happening in competitions,\u201d says a relaxed Rahi.\u201cI had very bad memories of the range, so we wanted to tackle that too.\u201dThe memories had been piling up for years. Rahi had shot some of her lowest scores in Munich (2011 and 2013), and 2017 was the most brutal. She was making a brave return from an elbow injury that had all but stalled her career. Her first competition was in Munich where her gun malfunctioned.\u201cI had never qualified for the finals in 13 competitions in Munich, leave alone win a medal. I found the range very, very cold. I once remember it was minus 2 degrees and we shoot outdoors (25m). Coming from a hot country, it\u2019s very difficult. It was windy, cloudy and raining and it was very harsh,\u201d reminisces Rahi, who was here to participate in season\u2019s fifth national trials in air pistol at the Karni Singh Range.Doubts cropped up in Rahi\u2019s mind every time she visited the Hochbr\u00fcck range. \u201cIt was important to get rid of those fears.\u201dThis time, Rahi made sure she would only encourage good thoughts. She shot down gold with a Tokyo Olympics quota in 25m pistol, six years after she won her first gold, in Changwon, South Korea. In the final, Rahi relived the haunted past through young Manu Bhaker, who was leading at one point but a pistol malfunction drowned her hopes. Rahi consoled Manu after the match. \u201cWhat happened with Manu happened with me (malfunction) five years back. I know how it feels.\u201dAfter Manu bowed out, Rahi ensured India returned with at least one quota place from 25m pistol. \u201cI have been shooting for 13 years and I have experienced all this so many times. Now I can manage different situations and conditions.\u201dA camp at Frankfurt Oder ahead of the Munich World Cup helped her acclimatise. Also, Rahi and her coach talked in detail about what was going wrong with her shooting. \u201cIn Delhi and China I had a chance. I had very good training sessions but I could not perform. We discussed many things, like psychological, mental and performance pressure. Technically, I was ready but, maybe, mentally I was not there (in Delhi and China World Cups),\u201d she says.The bad memories of the London Olympics, when she was only 21, were playing in her mind somewhere. \u201cI had gone to London at a very young age, too young to understand the level of competition at the Olympics. When I realised the magnitude of the task, I had lost my berth in the national squad. Subsequently, I got injured and was out of the action. At the start of the year, I was again trying hard to book an Olympic berth. This time, I was doing everything I could possibly do but still the performance was not coming. The bad patch created self-doubts; can I do it again?\u201dShe got her answers at the Asian Games in Jakarta last year where she became the first Indian woman shooter to win gold at the continental meet. The win brought her back in the reckoning, this time as an experienced shooter.\u201cThis Olympics will be eight years round the clock since 2012. It\u2019s very hard especially with injuries to believe that you can do it again. Many times you think of giving up. After the injury, I was shocked how can I shoot with this hand. I was there in the team but not performing to my expectations.\u201dShe got that belief back after hiring Dorjsuren, the Mongolian-German, as coach in 2017. The double world champion and double Olympic medallist instilled in her self-belief.Rahi now wants to make Munich her base and train for the 2020 Olympics. Shooters who have already qualified organise competitions and camps in Europe. \u201cI will try to compete in maximum number of competitions there. I am focusing on European competitions because most of the top shooters who have qualified will be competing there. \u201cGermany is the hub of shooting and Dorjsuren is part of the European Olympians group.

That is the lesson they can take from their World Cup experience. For the limited-overs team, the cycle heading into the mega event in England was spent searching for dashing batsmen who could complement the irrepressible top-order. But in the end, India landed at the tournament confused over who to fit where in the middle order.

After 90 ODIs, Rahane averages 35 with 24 fifties and three hundreds. They had experience, and going by numbers too, they were a safe bet. But expectations were simply too high. The team management appeared to be looking for someone better. Rahane and Rayudu offered solidity but were not in the Kohli-Sharma mould. They won\u2019t intimidate, but will do the job effectively.Ultimately, at the World Cup, KL Rahul batted at No 4 and Rahane looked on helplessly as he played for Hampshire in the County. The batting template adopted by KL Rahul\u2014build-up slowly and anchor the innings\u2014is similar to what we saw Rahane follow, but he was criticised.Rayudu abruptly announced his retirement at 33, after he was ignored even when a second player was injured in the World Cup and the middle-order cried out for reinforcement. Also Read: India tour of West Indies - 3 players who missed out on selection.As the new cycle begins post-World Cup, a fresh set of players are being tried. Among the choices, we again don\u2019t have names that will excite you to the level of Kohli and Sharma. They have picked Shreyas Iyer and Manish Pandey, and both will be wary of expectations. They will be conscious how Kohli and Sharma can make any batsman look ordinary. At the World Cup, a stroke player like Rahul paled in comparison to Sharma.Pandey and Iyer were among the batsmen who were tried out before the World Cup. The former underlined his potential with a superb ton against Australia in Sydney, the lone ODI India won during the five-match series in 2016. Thereafter the Karnataka batsman has been in and out of the team, struggling to match Kohli and Sharma, before the selectors finally discarded project-Pandey after the 2018 Asia Cup. He regained form in the second half of IPL and has consolidated his position with runs for India A, which he is captaining now in the West Indies. The unbeaten hundred in the third unofficial one-dayer proved timely for an India recall.Same is the case with the 24-year-old Iyer. He has played six ODIs and averages a decent 42 with two fifties, and is having a good run on the A tour in the West Indies. Iyer came back into reckoning after an impressive showing in IPL while leading Delhi Capitals.In their earlier stints, the two were left battling insecurities, and if the Indian team is looking at them as long-term prospects, they must be given time to settle down. The two will face stiff competition for a middle-order slot from KL Rahul and Kedar Jadhav. Chief selector MSK Prasad has promised to back them this time. \u201cI am sure you have seen by the way we have selected the team that we are looking ahead.\u201dThe two have been picked in the T20 squad too, with an eye on next year\u2019s T20 World Cup, the next big assignment in world cricket.Former India batsman, coach and selector Anshuman Gaekwad said the selectors and team management must show far-sightedness as far as a player\u2019s potential is concerned and back him through and through. \u201cIn the last two-three years we have tried 13-14 players; this can\u2019t happen. We should be able to judge who is there for the long term. You need them (Rahane) in places like England, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand, where conditions are tough to bat. You need to give the player assurance. It\u2019s not that he has done badly. When you try out so many new faces, you forget the old ones.\u201dGaekwad gave Rahul Dravid\u2019s example. \u201cWhen I was coach, the selectors were convinced Dravid was not a one-day player. It took me a long time to convince them and they relented when two sides had to be picked at the same time in 1998, for the Commonwealth Games and a one-day series in Toronto. Look where Dravid is now? He finished with 10,000 plus runs in ODIs. (In some ways) it is a similar case (with Rahane).\u201cIt was the same with Mohammad Azharuddin. His first game was my last Test and he got three hundreds in a row. After that he continuously kept failing, but the selectors never doubted his ability.\u201dIf Pandey and Iyer are hoping to blaze the turf like top-order men do, then they are also likely to trip up like Rahane and Rayudu.When asked about Rahane after Sunday\u2019s selection meeting, Prasad didn\u2019t have a convincing answer. \u201cHe was there in the scheme of things but we have to reward performances of India \u2018A\u2019. That is why we haven\u2019t included him.\u201dAll eyes are now on Pandey and Iyer. They have the potential to do their job effectively. The Indian team management has to lower its expectations and let them be themselves.","category":"sport"},{"title":"Pro Kabaddi 2019: Haryana Steelers beat Puneri Paltan 34-24","article":"Haryana Steelers began their campaign in the Pro Kabaddi Season 7 with an emphatic 34-24 win over Puneri Paltan here Monday.

I feel some decision will come. Otherwise, people will keep writing that (he) should retire, not retire. Because, no statement has come from Dhoni.\u201d While many experts believe Dhoni is a spent force, Azharuddin felt he can still continue if he has the drive and a body that is 100 percent fit.\u201cMy opinion is that if he is fit and playing well, he should play. If he is fit and performance is good, he can play. Sometimes what happens is, interest is lost after playing so much cricket. If his interest is still 100 per cent, I feel, he is good player and he should play,\u201d he said.\u201cBut, I just want to request him. Whenever he plays, he should play aggressively. Sometimes, reflexes slow down after certain age. But, Dhoni, it does not appear that the reflexes are slow. If he plays his natural game more, I feel that will be good for India.\u201d Azharuddin said Dhoni would take the right decision whenever it is to be taken.\u201cHe has taken rest for two months.

Sharma sunk a 45-foot birdie on the final hole to savour a career-best round of 68 at the Majors on the final day which took his total to three-over 287. The only other time he made the cut in a Major was at the 2018 Open at Carnoustie, where also he finished T-51.

MS Dhoni was also not picked as he opted to take a two month break from cricket to be with the parachute regiment.The focus was put on youngsters by the MSK Prasad-led selection committee as the likes of Navdeep Saini, Rishabh Pant, Rahul Chahar, Deepak Chahar and Khaleel Ahmed were given the nod for the tour. However, there were still some players who were unlucky to miss out on selection while for some it would feel like the end of the road for their international careers. 1.

After being picked as a second-choice wicket-keeper for the tournament, the team management put the trust in him and played him in the semi-finals against New Zealand.

Families are present in all political parties in India, but in many, they are in control of the party. Equally, a majority of the top 500 companies in India are family businesses. But is the logic of family predominance in politics and business the same? If not what defines the difference?Let us take politics first. Other than the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Left parties, most political parties are \u201ccontrolled\u201d by families - the Congress, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), the Samajwadi Party (SP), the Biju Janata Dal (BJD), the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), and the Shiv Sena (SS), to name a few.Max Weber had distinguished three types of legitimate political leadership, domination and authority \u2013 charismatic, traditional and legal authority. He defined authority as power accepted as legitimate by those subjected to it. He averred that charismatic authority grew out of the personal charm or strength of the individual, people obeyed the leader because they believe in him or her. This authority sustains as long as people believe in the leader, and does not sustain post the death of the leader unless converted into the other forms mentioned \u2013 traditional or legal authority. Traditional authority emanates from tradition or custom - a monarchy, clan leader, dominant elite, chosen successor, or family eldest. Legal authority stems from the legal office that a leader holds, an authority that goes when the leader leaves office.In this classification, parties like the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the BSP or are led by charismatic leaders and depend solely on them.?This was also the case with the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, under the late J Jayalalithaa. Parties that are family-led like the Congress, the SP, the DMK, and the SS are based on traditional authority and survive as long as the tradition stays strong, and the party leaders have enough patronage to dispense to their supporters. The reason family-led parties rarely convert to legal authority is because the family wants to stay in power, and is threatened by any institution that may challenge the family\u2019s authority. They only allow a second line to develop from within the family, and trust only members of the family not to usurp their power. The moment the family members lose their charisma, or their ability to succeed and offer their retainers patronage, the party starts to weaken. It fails to rejuvenate unless transformed. Finally, parties like the BJP and the Left ones are based on legal authority. Legal authority is more stable but needs to have a vision to offer its supporters. It needs to persuade people to believe in the underlying ideology that it espouses. If its ideology loses its appeal, or if its leaders do not ignite their supporters, then the party either adjusts its ideological moorings to the times or faces decline. The party leader enjoys authority only as long as they retain their office. This defines the challenge for families in politics. The advantage of traditional power after the charismatic leader goes cannot sustain, unless either the children are charismatic, or subject themselves to legal authority where the hold of the family diminishes and then declines. Why India\u2019s opposition needs to get its act togethere. billionaires and the guru: How a family burned through $2 billion.In contrast, the logic for family-run businesses is quite different. Once a business is established by the founder, the business becomes the wealth as well as occupation for the family. The wealth and prestige of the family is linked to the success of the business. The family does not need a mass following, only business acumen, to sustain and grow the business.Each succeeding generation of the family has a choice that their counterparts in politics do not \u2013 they can manage their involvement in the family business differently. They can choose between being passive owners, activist investors sitting on the Board of their companies, or being active owner-managers. This is in stark contrast to politics, where family members are either completely in or out.The dominant choice in India is for families to be owner-managers of their businesses.There is a common belief that family businesses tend not to survive beyond the third generation. While there is some truth in this statement, it is a bit unfair because most non-family businesses also don\u2019t survive beyond 60 years, and it is not that there are no family businesses that have survived beyond this time. Further the performance of owner-managed businesses compares quite favourably to non-family run businesses. There are many methods to prepare the next generation in a family for business. It is easy to instil the values of the family in the next generation. They grow up in an environment where dinner conversations are about the business. They have a longer-term view about their business, and are more deeply committed to the business than other employees. They can be trained, mentored to understand their industry, taught about their sector and given lessons on how to manage employees. If they are open (and if the family desires), their performance \u201ccan\u201d be measured objectively and feedback can be provided for development.This is not to say that family businesses do not face their own challenges. Interests start to diverge among the children, and conflicts arise on account of wealth sharing, succession, and capital allocation. As families become larger and shareholding gets fragmented, decision rights and shareholdings start to diverge. Unless the family sets in place a family charter and a governance structure before the disputes begin, the challenge of keeping the family business intact become harder. Family businesses can survive and succeed overtime if the family leaders pay careful attention on how to manage the family with fairness, transparency, and by instilling a meritocratic value structure that distinguishes between management and ownership so that the business can be well-managed.The political family in a democracy does not have the same advantage; charisma is not easy to pass on; and legal authority challenges the primacy of the family. Modi\u2019s attack on undeserving dynasts amply demonstrated this in our election. In the end, the role and success of a family in business and politics is very different. Families should introspect and recognise that success is earned and not assumed.","category":"politics"},{"title":"The new narrative: Good governance is good politics","article":"\u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid\u201d, a phrase coined by campaign strategist James Carville during Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 presidential campaign, was never synonymous with the Indian elections until 2019. For developed countries, the economy has always been the fulcrum of politics. In India, \u201cvoters do not cast their vote, but they vote their caste\u201d is a popular saying. The 2019 elections have introduced a new narrative \u2014 good economics is good politics through social empowerment.Putting the citizen first is the guiding principle of good governance. It is this ideology that brings stakeholders, the government and the citizens closer to each other. Good governance is the key to a country\u2019s prosperity and progress. For this to happen, it is important that the citizens become active participants in governance. Swachh Bharat is a textbook example. The redressal of public grievances assures the citizens that their vote has not gone wasted. Technology is an important tool for good governance as it ensures transparency and accountability which result in the betterment and welfare of all citizens. It also leads to the simplification of processes. The best example is the self-certification of startups introduced by the Narendra Modi government, exhibiting trust in their citizens. Digital India ensures that government services are available to the citizen with little human interference.These features of good governance were the hallmark of the Modi-led National Democratic Alliance-I government. Social empowerment, which came through good economics, is now good politics.Voters choose a stable government with a strong, decisive leadership. Now, development has become the buzzword. With the coming of age of social media, people can make more informed choices in many areas. Understanding this, Modi has mastered the skill of optimising social media as a tool to connect with the people.Your words matter, not numbers, PM tells Opposition Building a global urban narrative For the first time, we are seeing a government that is determined to improve the socioeconomic status of the people. Niti Aayog selected 100 districts and called them Aspirational Districts, focusing on health and nutrition, education, agriculture and water resources, financial inclusion and skill development. These core areas have a direct bearing on the quality of life and the economic productivity of citizens. The prime minister himself, along with the Niti Aayog, monitors the outcomes on a continuous basis with the state governments.In Uttar Pradesh, eight backward districts have been selected as aspirational: Balrampur, Shravasti, Bahraich, Siddharth Nagar, Chandauli, Sonbhadra, Fatehpur and Chitrakoot. They are already showing positive results. Such microplanning has never been seen in Indian political governance. Known popularly as the \u201cModi Development Model\u201d, it was adopted by the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath. A state once known for bad roads, negligible electricity, the lack of doctors and teachers, farmers burdened with loans, and poor law and order, has turned around by adopting good economics with good politics. Within a year, the Adityanath government had received proposals worth Rs 4.68 lakh crore. Uttar Pradesh is gradually becoming the favourite stop for investors in India.The new narrative for political parties has become development. The focus of voters is now performance and the economy has become an undisputable way to indicate growth and success. The electorate feels a direct connect to something tangible. The 2019 elections have given a new dimension to the phrase, good economics is good politics, but via social empowerment.Sidharth Nath Singh is Cabinet minister for health (UP) and a government spokespersonThe views expressed are personal.","category":"politics"},{"title":"\u2018Kedarnath trip to meet inner self, not for politics\u2019: Modi\u2019s Mann ki Baat","article":"Prime Minister Narendra Modi replied to controversies over his Kedarnath trip and the last \u201cMann ki Baat\u201d apart from reminding his listeners of the importance of upholding democracy and reading books.

Hindi lovers from all over the world had gathered in Johannesburg. I was presiding over the media session of the 10th World Hindi Conference. Mani Shankar Aiyar was the chief guest. In his speech, Aiyar had said that nothing could be as good as a person from Bihar arriving in a village in Tamil Nadu and people there asking him in Hindi, \u201cBhai kaise ho?\u201d Similarly, if a Tamilian were to go to a village in Bihar and be asked, \u201cNeeng epdi irikel?\u201dThere are two reasons why I still remember those moments- first that I realised that Aiyar was absolutely right in what he was saying. He is from Tamil Nadu though he was born in Lahore. Besides Tamil and Hindi, he is conversant in Punjabi and Urdu. How I wish, other Indians knew one or more Indian language besides their mother tongue. After the session was over, some young people emerged from the crowd and asked me where Mani Shankar Aiyar was. One of them asked why Aiyar felt Hindi speakers should know Tamil. I again asked what their response would be if a Tamil speaker spoke in Hindi. They said it was the duty of every citizen of the country to know Hindi.Languages and dialects are like those relatives whom we accept at our own will and who cannot be imposed on us. In 1937, when the government was formed in Madras Presidency, C Gopalachari made the use of Hindi mandatory in schools. Periyar and many pro-Tamil leaders were vocal in their protest. The movement became violent. The police had to use force in many places and some lives were lost. From then on, Tamil parties have resented Hindi.Our Parliament was also affected. After much debate, the Official Language Resolution was passed in 1968. As per the resolution, Hindi-speaking states had to teach an Indian language besides Hindi and in non-Hindi speaking states, Hindi was to be taught besides English and the local or regional language. This three-language formula was accepted by everyone but Tamil Nadu was adamant.In 1971, when I took admission in the 6th standard, I was given three options for languages. Telugu, Kannada or Bangla? We lived in Tagore town in Allahabad those days where a large number of Bengalis lived. I opted for Bangla and for the next three years I got the opportunity to understand the language. While writing these lines I can say proudly that this also awakened an interest in reading the immortal literature of Bengal. No place for Hindi in Tamil Nadu, says AIADMK .Now we come to the present day. When the Central government saw the resentment increasing it explained that it did not want to impose Hindi on anyone. Politics has always followed the policy of one step forward two steps back as far as languages are concerned. When the Hindi-speakers of our generation were growing up, Lohiya had launched the \u2018angrezi hatao\u2019 (remove English) movement. Many people boycotted English. It felt good to hear that if Soviet Russia, China, France or Germany could progress so much without English, then India too could grow with Hindi? But this only damaged us. Hindi speakers faced difficulties in getting employment and found themselves at a disadvantage on many other fronts because they didn\u2019t know English well. In exactly the same way, Tamil speakers faced more problems than people from Karnataka or unified Andhra Pradesh when they came to Delhi or any other part of the country. We should love our own language, but if we close the doors on other languages, we are shutting out so much knowledge. The census of 2011 is an eye-opener. In the beginning of that decade, the number of Hindi speakers and those who could understand Hindi was over 52 crores. This number increased by 10 crores from 2001 to 2011. The biggest reason for the increase which will continue is that people are now moving on to the emerging metropolitan cities in search of employment opportunities. According to the previous data, the number of people speaking Hindi, Oriya and Assamese in the southern regions has increased by 33%. Clearly, after commercial activities increased in the cities of Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Chennai and Surat, people from the east and north have started coming and settling down in these cities.One aspect which is often forgotten is the contribution of our Bollywood films. Hindi films which are produced in Mumbai, considered to be a Hindi-speaking city have played a significant role in spreading the language all over the country. There was a time when we knew of actors like Rajinikanth, Mohan Lal, Rekha, Hema Malini or Sridevi only through these films. Now with the changing times, the cinema from the south has also been becoming popular. Baahubali was dubbed in Hindi also and it broke all box office records.","category":"politics"},{"title":"\u2018Shibu Soren should have taken retirement from active politics\u2019","article":"One of the senior BJP?leaders of Bihar and state\u2019s health minister, Mangal Pandey played a key role as the party in-charge in its emphatic victory in Jharkhand, where the BJP?won 12 out of the 14 Lok Sabha seats while fighting a united Opposition.

Leaders of our coalition partners, including All Jharkhand Students\u2019 Union , Janata Dal United (JDU) and Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) helped us carry the positive message to the masses.Was there any special strategy after the BJP\u2019s debacle in the recent bypolls?After assuming the charge of Jharkhand, I held rounds of meetings with party workers from booth to the state level. My 30 years of experience of working with the party helped me identify issues. My efforts lifted morale of the workers, who finally delivered the good for the party and the nation. The opposition led by the Congress was united and trying to play it up against the state government. Did you expect such a landslide?There was a basic different between 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Contrary to 2014 polls, all opposition parties like Congress, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Jharkhand Vikas Morcha-Prajatantrik (JVM-P) got united and sought to project the alliance like a major force. Sensing their strategy, BJP put all its resources to apprise the masses about the schemes of central and the state governments, ensured they were implemented on time and their benefits reached the last person. People were made to realize that the BJP was the only party that could cater to the present needs of the country.Did Pulwama attack on CMPF convey and Balakot air strike help the BJP override the opposition\u2019s unity?It is for the first time that nationalism grew up as a major political issue, when people began crying for all out war against terror and national security, rising above all caste, social and sectarian lines. A perception was built among the people that the nation is first for one and all. And it worked to mobilize the electors in support of the BJP and the NDA.In the BJP\u2019s wave, political stalwarts of Jharkhand like JMM chief Sibu Soren and JVM-P president Babulal Marandi were swept aside. What does it signify for Jharkhand?JMM founder Shibu Soren should have taken retirement from active politics, as he had crossed the age. And his defeat in his stronghold of Dumka made it amply clear. The way Babulal Marandi faced massive defeat in Koderma, it seems people made him to take voluntary retirement. People of Jharkhand also taught a lesson to Congress.

It is of immense significance for the party in Haryana as our candidates primarily fought in the name of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his leadership. It [the victory] will be a big morale booster for the party workers and leaders as each one of us played their part.What are your plans for the upcoming assembly polls?We have worked hard to bring complete transparency and fairness in the functioning of the state government and we would further improve this in our next term. Though we have no plans for early assembly polls, it is up to the Election Commission to decide the dates as states like Maharashtra and Jharkhand are due for assembly polls around the same time.","category":"politics"},{"title":"Lok Sabha elections 2019: Crunching numbers to make sense of politics","article":"At HT, our data coverage of the 2019 general elections has been driven by two basic principles. Indian elections are best understood by taking a state-wise approach, given the linguistic and other socio-economic diversities in our country. And, politics needs to be seen as a continuous process between the 2014 and the 2019 general elections, rather than assuming that there has been a five-year vacuum between the two. We believe that a careful analysis of these two factors can allow us to put the 2019 results in a macro-yet-disaggregated perspective. Along with this, we have also tried to use the elections to explore some larger political economy ideas that have an important role in shaping the political processes of our country. Here\u2019s a recap of some of our important stories that we have done as part of our national election coverage.The Election Commission of India (ECI) announced the schedule for 2019 general elections on March 10. In their first data story (https:\/\/bit.ly\/30BtwRo) after the polls were officially announced, we gave a snapshot of how decimating the Congress in direct contest states and forging a multi-class, multi-caste collation helped the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secure a majority of its own in the Lok Sabha in 2014. The story also looked at parliamentary constituency (PC) wise extrapolated results from assembly elections held between 2014 and 2019. Another story on March 19 underlined the importance of states vis-\u00e0-vis the first-past-the-post system, where regional parties in bigger states such as West Bengal and Tamil Nadu end up getting a relatively higher seat share for a given vote share compared to national parties. The story also pointed out the importance of nine states \u2013 Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Maharashtra and Gujarat \u2013 in the seat tally of the BJP in the country. Read More| An app to track real-time trends on counting dayWe also looked at political data in each specific state to explain the importance of various factors including alliance arithmetic in shaping the 2019 results. Some of our work underlined the importance of looking differently even within a state, such as a May 2 story that explained the relatively higher vulnerability of the BJP in Uttar Pradesh vis-\u00e0-vis the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Samajwadi Party (SP) alliance.An April 3 story on Karnataka tried to explain how the impressive headline vote share numbers of the Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular) alliance in Karnataka might not lead to a rout of the BJP in the state. Voter turnouts are the only authentic data that is available for analysis when the election process in on. In his April 28 story, Kawoosa pointed out the Kashmir valley was headed for lowest voter turnout in two decades. The final numbers, a turnout of 18.9% in the three PCs in the Kashmir valley have confirmed the argument. Another story on May 8 pondered on whether the relatively higher increase in voter turnout in the states of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan pointed towards a restoration of political competition in the state unlike 2014, when a section of anti-BJP voters might not have come out to vote expecting imminent defeat.The 2019 election is the first in which the EC has decided to introduce candidate pictures along with their electoral symbols on the electronic voting machines. In this March 18 story Kawoosa scraped ECI data to show the extent of problems caused by namesake candidates in elections. Elections in India also generate a lot of focus on the importance of caste in the country. This March 27 story cautioned readers about relying too much on headline caste demographic numbers even at the state level. Another April 4 story tried to explain the complicated relationship between caste and class in Indian politics by highlighting how economic fortunes of similar broad caste groups vary significantly across states and how Other Backward Classes (OBCs) thanks to their large share in population have a significantly large share among the richer sections of the society.Also Read| Nitish Kumar says summer not appropriate for polls, calls for fewer phasesApart from this author, Abhishek Jha and Vijdan Mohammad Kawoosa, HT\u2019s data coverage was complemented by columnists such as Neelanjan Sircar, a senior visiting fellow at Centre for Policy Research and an assistant professor at Ashoka University, Gilles Verniers, co-director of the Trivedi Centre for Political Data at Ashoka University, and Milan Vaishanav, Director of South Asia Programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace at Washington DC.","category":"politics"},{"title":"\u2018Ready to quit politics if proved DMK in talks with BJP\u2019, says Stalin","article":"DMK president MK Stalin on Tuesday rubbished the claims of Tamil Nadu BJP president Tamilisai Soundarrajan who claimed that the Dravidian major was in talks with the saffron party and said he would quit politics if proved otherwise.\u201cIf Tamilisai Soundarrajan or Narendra Modi, whom she wants to become Prime Minister again prove that I am talking to them for an alliance with the BJP, I\u2019m prepared to quit politics.

So I got up late. I really don\u2019t know what has happened there.\u201d The journalists received this reply from Bengali actress Moon Moon Sen when she was asked what caused the electoral violence in her parliamentary constituency, Asansol. That day, there was another surprising scene on TV. This time it was Sunny Deol. As soon as he stepped out of the polling booth after casting his vote, journalists questioned him about his new political avatar. He first folded his hands and then ran towards his car without saying anything. In my experience of 40 years as a journalist, I have seen many good and bad events, but never before have I witnessed such scenes.Let\u2019s first look at Moon Moon Sen. In 2014, Babul Supriyo was elected from Asansol. He is a Union minister of state and a well-known singer. Perhaps Mamata Banerjee thought that Moon Moon Sen is more popular than Babul Supriyo and so she will definitely be able to defeat him. Sunny Deol has also been given ticket from Gurdaspur solely on this basis. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) high command may have thought that if Dharmendra in 2009 and Hema Malini in 2014 can win on the basis of sheer glamour from regions they are not directly identified with, then why not Sunny Deol? Moreover, he has replaced Vinod Khanna, so this would be a seamless transition.It was perhaps on this basis that the actress of yesteryears, Urmila Matondkar, was selected as a candidate. Matondkar has no political experience but now she is a Congress Lok Sabha candidate from North Mumbai.This practice of film stars joining politics started in south India way back in the 1960s. After about two decades, the trend caught up in the north too. I remember, in the initial phase, actors had to face a lot many problems. In 1984, Amitabh Bachchan was contesting against Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna in Allahabad. At that time, many who considered Allahabad the country\u2019s intellectual capital were quite displeased with the fact that though it was not unconstitutional to field an actor against such a famous and prominent leader, it was certainly improper. Noted poet and Amitabh\u2019s father, Harivansh Rai Bachchan, himself had to camp in Allahabad to placate these people. Lok Sabha elections 2019: Shetty vs Matondkar contest in Mumbai North delivers the highest turnout It is not a coincidence that almost all the political parties have a preference for film stars and sports figures. These parties work and function through their workers. Many senior leaders of various parties have worked relentlessly and selflessly for their parties. Then, it is puzzling that they are neglecting their own party workers.To what extent can the people who get tickets to contest elections without even being familiar with the party\u2019s principles prove to be the well-wishers of the party? Take, for example, Sapna Choudhary. At first, she was rumoured to have joined the Congress but the very next day she was seen singing the praises of the BJP.Unfortunately, Indian politics is either driven by dynasties or fairweather entrants. Haven\u2019t we been degenerating step by step in every election because of this?I am reminded of a scene from the film Anari. In it, Raj Kapoor finds the wallet which belongs to Motilal, who had dropped it. As Raj Kapoor approaches Motilal to return the wallet, some goons attack him. Thrashed and with his clothes torn, he somehow manages to reach the club where Motilal is and returns the wallet. Motilal looks at him with surprise and says something which has always stayed with me. \u201cYoung man, all these people you see around here must have got some wallets, which were dropped at one point or another, which they did not return.\u201dIndian politics is also turning into a club for the elite. Those who came to the corridors of power by struggling in the name of democracy are either too ambitious and later doomed to become like those very people they had protested against. That\u2019s why our democracy has now been reduced to a mere chariot for some families, corporates and the glamour brigade. The voters may nurture the illusion of driving this chariot if they want to, but the fact is what they consider the power to elect is not in their hands at all. Is this democracy or a mere mirage?","category":"politics"},{"title":"\u2018When an economist turns politician...\u2019: Arun Jaitley targets Manmohan Singh","article":"In a counter-attack, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Sunday accused former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of leaving behind an economy in slowdown, after Singh\u2019s criticism that the Indian economy is in \u201cdire straits\u201d under PM Modi and also predicted that it is headed for a slowdown.In a series of tweets, Jaitley pointed out that it was Manmohan Singh who left behind an economy in slowdown in 2014. He further said policy paralysis and corruption were also Manmohan Singh\u2019s gifts to the Modi government. Jaitley also credited the former PM of bringing down the Congress party to its lowest tally in parliament in the last Lok Sabha elections. India was a part of the fragile five during the former PM\u2019s time, Jaitley said in another tweet.\u201cWhen an Economist turns into a politician, he looses sense of both economy and politics,\u201d tweeted Jaitley.The comments came after Manmohan Singh, in an interview to PTI, found fault with PM Modi\u2019s five-year rule, describing it as \u201cmost traumatic and devastating\u201d. Singh, known as the architect of India\u2019s economic reforms in 1990s, felt the country is headed for a slowdown and accused the Modi regime of leaving the country\u2019s economy in \u201cdire straits\u201d.

Microsoft does not provide an absolute revenue figure for Azure, blending it into its \u201cintelligent cloud unit,\u201d which had revenue of $11.4 billion compared with analyst expectations of $11.0 billion, according to Refinitiv data.Microsoft also forecasted between $10.3 billion and $10.5 billion in intelligent cloud sales for the fiscal first quarter, with a midpoint above analyst estimates of $10.13 billion. The forecast helped send shares of Microsoft up more than 2.6% to record highs above $140 in after-hours trading.Cloud growth powered Microsoft\u2019s market value past $1 trillion for the first time in April. On Thursday, Microsoft\u2019s Azure-based business segment for the first time ever reported slightly more quarterly revenue than its Windows-based segment.\u201cThe pressure was obviously on but they executed,\u201d said Hal Eddins, chief economist for Microsoft shareholder Capital Investment Counsel. \u201cThe cloud is such a key driver of growth for them and they seem to have painted a big bullseye on the back of AWS.\u201dIn the cloud computing business, Azure\u2019s chief rival is Amazon Web Services, which dominates the industry with a 32.8% market share, according to research firm Canalys. Microsoft has a share of 14.6%, while Google has 9.9%.Microsoft has also gained ground in the past year by bundling its Azure computing service for developers along with Office and other software products for end users, such as in the more than $2 billion cloud deal it signed with AT&T Inc earlier this week.Microsoft has tried to set itself apart from AWS by combining its traditional software that runs in a customer\u2019s own data centre with its Azure products, a strategy that Chris Voce, analyst at Forrester, said helped power the company\u2019s results.Revenue in Microsoft\u2019s productivity software unit jumped 14.3% to $11.05 billion, driven by double-digit revenue growth for LinkedIn and Office 365. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $10.71 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\u201cIts hybrid cloud strategy has resonated with enterprises where this is a more realistic and flexible approach,\u201d Voce said.Meanwhile, its personal computing division, home to Windows software, rose to $11.3 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $10.98 billion. The unit also includes Xbox gaming consoles, the Bing online search service and Surface laptops.Mike Spencer, head of investor relations at Microsoft, said Windows results were fuelled by customers upgrading from Windows 7, which will be retired next year, and the result of some PC customers stockpiling inventory in anticipation of possible tariffs.\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is there was even maybe more pent-up demand than we anticipated,\u201d Spencer said.

Even those who bought VR headsets -- either as an independent unit or bundled with smartphones -- have dumped those at home.According to the International Data Corporation (IDC), the global Augmented Reality (AR) and VR headset market returned to growth after a full year of decline in the first quarter this year, as global shipments reached 1.3 million -- up 27.2 per cent -- from the same quarter last year.VR headsets represented 96.6 per cent of the combined AR\/VR market during the quarter with strong volumes from top companies such as Sony, Facebook, HTC, Pico and 3Glasses.There is no doubt that enterprise AR is evolving quickly, especially in the fields of healthcare, education and at firms that aim to enhance customer experiences.\u201cMany companies are actively looking for hardware solutions they can use to improve existing business processes and drive new ones,\u201d says Tom Mainelli, Group Vice President, Consumer and Devices Research, at IDC.However, VR headsets have failed to strike a chord with the consumers.\u201cOne of the main reasons why VR is not booming into the consumer segment is because of the uncomfortable, clunky headsets -- even early VR adopters have complained of mental fatigue due to prolonged use of VR headsets,\u201d Prabhu Ram, Head - Industry Intelligence Group (IIG), CMR, told IANS.\u201cSecondly, there is a clear dearth of quality VR content that one could watch,\u201d he added.According to Delhi-based tech entrepreneur Tanuj Malhotra, who is working on his own VR startup called VRover, the technology is not going to come to life anytime soon.Reports suggest that even as a relatively young technology, AR has shown more promise than VR as it involves adding visual elements to the real world -- typically via smartphones. Unlike VR, it does not push users into distinct virtual environments.\u201cIt is impossible for VR to take off and compete with AR unless vendors make some serious changes from the consumers\u2019 perspective,\u201d said Malhotra.\u201cVR content out there is not readily available to consumers. Also, the VR technology is not able to rule out nausea and other health-related issues while experiencing it,\u201d he added.According to Jack McCauley, one of the co-founders of Oculus, Facebook-acquired VR firm Oculus may not be profitable as the social networking giant is struggling to bring VR to the mainstream consumer market.","category":"tech"},{"title":"Hyundai Mobis\u2019s new camera system could replace vehicle side mirrors","article":"South Korea\u2019s largest auto parts maker Hyundai Mobis on Sunday said it has developed a camera monitoring system that will replace side-view mirrors in next-generation vehicles.With the advanced sensor technology, Hyundai Mobis has joined a couple of global future mobility developers and it aims to export the technology to carmakers, Yonhap news agency reported.Three high-performance camera sensors inside the vehicle will not only increase driving safety by significantly reducing blind spots, and but also improve fuel efficiency as side-view mirrors will be hidden inside the car, Hyundai Mobis said in a statement.\u201cThe paradigm shift to the future car is demanding both functional and design upgrades of all core components, which have been taken for granted until today,\u201d Vice President Gregory Baratoff in charge of autonomous vehicle development at Hyundai Mobis said in the statement.The company will not only develop element technologies, like sensors and solutions based on them, but also the core parts portfolio that it has already secured in accordance with the future car era, he said","category":"tech"},{"title":"Red Hat bets big on India after $34 billion acquisition by IBM","article":"After the International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) completed the acquisition of Red Hat for $34 billion earlier this month, a top executive from the iconic software company with an open source development model has said that it was a \u201cmatch made in heaven\u201d that will help it accelerate growth globally, including in India.In India, Red Hat, which specialises in Linux operating systems, has engineering facilities in Pune and Bengaluru.\u201cWe do think that there is an opportunity to accelerate growth (after the acquisition) -- not just in the India market, but also in the broader market. But it does exist for sure in India. I think we have an opportunity to scale much more quickly,\u201d John Allessio, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Global Services, Red Hat Inc, told IANS in a freewheeling chat here.The acquisition by Big Blue won\u2019t change Red Hat\u2019s \u201cmission\u201d, nor will it curtail its contribution to the open source community, Allessio stressed.Raleigh, North Carolina-headquartered Red Hat reported $3.4 billion in revenue in the 2019 financial year -- up 15 per cent year-on-year.\u201cRed Hat has experienced 69 quarters of continuous growth which means every quarter you are hiring people across the word and that is going to continue for sure,\u201d Allessio said. \u201cAfter the acquisition, we are still an independent software company. What changed is that instead of having an external shareholder, we now have an internal shareholder,\u201d he explained.Founded in 1993, Red Hat is credited for bringing open source -- including technologies like Linux, Kubernetes, Ansible, Java and Ceph, among others -- into the mainstream for the enterprises. Today, Red Hat products and services are widely used by government agencies as well as emerging companies in technology, finance, healthcare, civil aviation and other industries.Armonk, New York-headquartered IBM particularly hopes that Red Hat\u2019s open hybrid Cloud technologies would help it position itself as a leading hybrid Cloud provider.\u201cAt the core of what we do is turning projects in the open source communities into products because at the end of the day, our customer is an enterprise software customer,\u201d Allessio said.\u201cI think it is an opportunity for IBM to learn this DNA of Red Hat -- how do we do it -- and decide -- they have not yet decided -- if this applies to the IBM software development process. IBM has already stated that they are very much interested in our services division,\u201d Allessio added.IBM also participates in open source communities, but it does not \u201cproductise\u201d the open source projects. Instead, it develops its own proprietary products.What has fundamentally changed after the acquisition is that IBM is no longer just a business partner for Red Hat, it is now a strategic business partner.\u201cFrom a go to market to operations, development and support, IBM does not help Red Hat. They help us by being a new strategic business partner,\u201d he said, adding that Red Hat will continue to operate with its other business partners.","category":"tech"},{"title":"After Samsung, LG to launch M-series smartphones with \u2018LG M10\u2019","article":"Following Samsung\u2019s footsteps, South Korean conglomerate LG Group is planning to launch a new line-up of M-Series devices, targeting the Indian market.Corroborating through a filing with the KIPRIS (Korean Intellectual Property Rights Information Service), LG has registered to use the name \u201cM10\u201d for a future device, GSMArena reported on Friday.Earlier in June, the company introduced its W-series in India that brought along three devices -- \u201cW10\u201d, \u201cW30\u201d, and \u201cW30 Pro\u201d.Since details about the upcoming M-line-up of LG\u2019s devices have not been disclosed, it is being speculated that the new series would also bring three smartphones named like the devices of the W-series.In addition, LG has filed for two more names -- \u201cV60\u201d and \u201cV70\u201d.

The official renders, which partially show the phone, revealed some radical changes in the phone such as square camera module, unibody design and more. Now, new leaked images of Google Pixel give us a closer look at the next flagship phone.According to leakster Ice Universe, Google Pixel 4 is set to come with a full-screen display but without the wobbly notch as seen in the previous generation. The screen comes with larger bottom and top bezels. The Verge points out the bezels look much bigger than the popular premium phones such as Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus and OnePlus 7 Pro. The top bezel of Google Pixel 4 is set to feature front-facing cameras (dual-camera setup) and sensors.\u00a0The latest images are pretty much in line with the earlier rumours and leaks of the phone. That said, Google is not giving a big facelift to the front but also the back panel. According to its own official renders, Google Pixel 4 will come with a square camera module, akin to rumored iPhone 11. The phone is expected to come with at least three rear cameras. Google Pixel 3 XL comes with just one rear camera at 12-megapixel resolution. It has 8MP and 8MP dual-front cameras, though.Apart from square camera module, you will also notice the unibody design instead of the current combination of glossy glass panel on the top and matte-finish panel at the bottom. The company is also relocating the fingerprint sensor from the back. Google Pixel 4 is expected to come with fingerprint on display or embedded within the power button on the sides.","category":"tech"},{"title":"PUBG updates: Season 8 for Mobile, PC gets new season with original narrative, and more","article":"What a week for PUBG fans.

With the price starting at Rs 27,999, Redmi K20 pro is set to compete with the likes of Asus 6Z, OnePlus 7, OnePlus 7 Pro and other premium smartphones.Xiaomi Redmi K20 Pro is also the cheapest Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor-powered phone in the market right now. While performance is a big highlight of the phone, Redmi K20 Pro also offers impressive camera specifications.The latest Redmi phone comes with a triple-rear camera setup consisting of 48-megapixel (Sony IMX58 sensor, 1.6\u03bcm large 4-in-1 large pixel, 6P, f\/1.75 aperture), 8-megapixel telephoto lens, 2x Optical Zoom, 1.12\u03bcm pixel size, f\/2.4 aperture, and 13-megapixel 124.8-degree super wide-angle lens, 1.12\u03bcm pixel size, f\/2.4 aperture. The camera supports laser focus with PDAF, up to 4K UHD video recording at 30fps\/60fps, and 960fps slow-motion video recording. The phone offers EIS for image stabilisation. For selfies, it has a 20-megapixel front-facing camera with full HD video recording support.Redmi K20 Pro: Camera UIXiaomi Redmi K20 Pro comes with a slightly modified camera interface which makes it easier to access the key features. For instance, 48-megapixel camera mode is now part of the bottom modes instead of being buried under the in-app settings.Upon launching the camera app, you get the default camera settings. On top, you have flash, HDR, AI, and preloaded filters shortcut. Tapping on the hamburger button on the right top corner, you can access Settings and other key features and modes like timer, square (1:1), tilt-shift and straighten. Under the Settings, you can tweak a few things such as enable\/disable save location info, correct distortion in ultra-wide shots, camera frame and more.At the bottom you have different modes such as short video, slow motion, video, photo, 48MP, portrait, night, panorama, and Pro.Redmi K20 Pro: Daylight shotsXiaomi Redmi K20 Pro thrives in daylight conditions. Images are bright and crisp. Unlike some other smartphones in this segment and even in budget segments, photos aren\u2019t oversaturated. The smartphone also captures great details when taking close-up shots. If you love macro photography, Redmi K20 Pro will not disappoint you.Xiaomi Redmi K20 Pro takes decent indoor photos but it struggles a bit when it comes to capturing photos outdoors. There\u2019s a fair amount of noise and some photos came off little blurry. The dedicated Night Mode does help improve quality. That said, Redmi K20 Pro\u2019s lowlight performance isn\u2019t any better or worse than OnePlus 7 Pro. There\u2019s very little difference between the two phones when it comes low light shots.Redmi K20 Pro: Lowlight performanceRedmi K20 Pro: Using modes, lensesXiaomi\u2019s Redmi K20 Pro comes with the 48-megapixel rear camera. It\u2019s the same Sony IMX586 sensor. The phone, however, offers much better details than its budget counterpart. Another upgrade you will notice is how fast the 48-megapixel photos are processed. The mode itself is still at nascent stages and it\u2019s likely to improve with future generations of the phone. For instance, who\u2019d not love to have an optical zoom with 48-megapixel sensors.The AI and HDR mode are on par with what you get on other phones. The features bring auto optimisation of your shot which makes a lot of sense for casual mobile photography enthusiasts. HDR mode is also satisfactory.","category":"tech"},{"title":"WhatsApp\u2019s top security, privacy features that every user needs to know","article":"With over 200 million monthly active users, WhatsApp is the most popular instant messaging app in India. Over the years, WhatsApp has improved the platform with new features such as video calling and stickers. Of late, WhatsApp has increased focus on bettering its security and privacy features, especially after it was widely criticised over the spread of fake news and misinformation.From the forwarded label, fact-check to suspicious link detection, WhatsApp has added multiple new features in last one year or so. WhatsApp recently revealed it bans over 2 million accounts per month for abusing the platform. While WhatsApp is fixing the spam and fake news problem, here are some of the top privacy and security features that every WhatsApp user needs to know.Two-step verificationTwo-step verification is possibly the easiest way to add another layer of security to your account. Google and Facebook also stress on having two-step verification. For WhatsApp, it helps you verify your account through a six-digit PIN that you create using the feature.To enable two-step verification, WhatsApp users need to visit Settings > Account > Two-step verification > Enable. You also have the option to enter your email address which can be used in the case you forget the six-digit PIN.Protecting WhatsApp profile photosWhatsApp doesn\u2019t come with Facebook\u2019s screen-guard feature that notifies users when someone copies or takes a screenshot of their profile photos. What WhatsApp users can do for now is tweaking the Settings to ensure their profile photo is only visible to their contacts. You can also set the profile photos\u2019 visibility to no one. Here\u2019s how to do it: Go to Settings > Account > Privacy > Profile Photos > Choose between \u201cEveryone\u201d, \u201cMy Contacts\u201d and \u201cNobody.\u201dALSO\u2009READ:\u2009WhatsApp to soon add QR\u2009Code support, here\u2019s how it worksReporting, blocking and moreSecurity notificationsIf you\u2019re receiving spams from an unknown number, here\u2019s what you need to do. Open the chat, tap on the sender name (individual or group) to open their profile. Scroll to the bottom and tap \u201cReport Contact\u201d or \u201cReport group.\u201d You can also block the number. Users can also exit the group that is sending spam.When enabled, the feature alerts users when a contact\u2019s security code has changed. \u201cSecurity codes are just visible versions of the special key shared between you - and don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not the actual key itself, that\u2019s always kept secret. At times, the security codes used in end-to-end encryption might change. This is likely because you or your contact reinstalled WhatsApp or changed phones,\u201d explains WhatsApp on its website.To activate this feature, launch WhatsApp on your phone. Go to Settings > tap on Account > Security > toggle the button to \u201cShow Security Notifications.\u201dNote that WhatsApp offers end-to-end encryption regardless of this setting.","category":"tech"},{"title":"FaceApp may have your photo, but Facebook, Google know more about you","article":"Sure, I like privacy in the abstract. But I\u2019m applying for an apartment in New York City, and I just sent out my only slightly redacted W-2, credit history and screenshots of my bank account to several people just because they said they\u2019re real estate brokers.So I cannot judge the thousands of Americans who sent in a picture of themselves to a Russian-made smartphone application that they hadn\u2019t heard of the day before. FaceApp is a viral app that allows people to create startlingly realistic images of themselves as seniors or as children. And this week, it incited a panic as reports emerged that people using the app were sending their images to a little-known Russian company for doctoring.The scandal is not surprising. Whether it\u2019s a hip thing like FaceApp (literally all it does is age you)\u2014or the age-old torture of applying for an urban apartment\u2014it doesn\u2019t take much to get any of us to hand over our data.I have no idea whether people should be wary of FaceApp in particular. Security researchers have found no evidence that it sucks up all your photos or does anything similarly nefarious. The company said it deletes most images within 48 hours and that it will remove user data upon request.The fact that it\u2019s Russian isn\u2019t enough to discredit it. But Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has called for an FBI investigation. And if we were living in a movie, the all-powerful facial recognition machine that brings humanity to its knees would certainly be built on the back of viral human vanity.Facebook\u2019s opponents argue that by breaking it up, its various pieces and their competitors would be forced to compete by offering superior privacy protections. But with so many people so willing to trade their data for convenience (or a discount, or an apartment, or a face filter), the invisible hand of the market probably won\u2019t\u00a0protect us from tech overreach.The most obvious answer is privacy regulation. This is why we elect leaders to create a regulatory state to watch out for us.\u00a0I\u2019m not particularly interested in investigating the factory farm that pumps out the eggs that I buy. That\u2019s why I rely on the Food and Drug Administration to keep an eye on things.I\u2019m sure some privacy-minded people will object to this sort of\u00a0defeatism. Yes, people can take some responsibility for their privacy. As in, maybe do some background googling before downloading an app from a company that you\u2019ve never heard of? But more likely, people will just embrace the post-privacy dystopia. If regulators won\u2019t police the most obvious targets, Apple, Google and Facebook (which has even called for regulations!), I guess the Russians can enjoy looking at our smiling, na\u00efve faces.But in the absence of strong government oversight in the internet world, we\u2019ve had to rely on app stores and other log-in tools to protect us. That has some mixed results. And it\u00a0means the gatekeepers\u2014Apple Inc., Google and Facebook, in particular\u2014know a ton about us","category":"tech"},{"title":"Indian-origin scientists develop AI system to detect deepfakes","article":"At a time when deepfake videos become a new threat to users\u2019 privacy, a team of Indian-origin researchers has developed Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven deep neural network that can identify manipulated images at the pixel level with high precision.Realistic videos that map the facial expressions of one person onto those of another -- known as deepfakes, present a formidable political weapon in the hands of nation-state bad actors.Led by Amit Roy-Chowdhury, professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California, Riverside, the team is currently working on still images but this can help them detect \u201cdeepfake\u201d videos.\u201cWe trained the system to distinguish between manipulated and nonmanipulated images and now if you give it a new image, it is able to provide a probability that that image is manipulated or not, and to localize the region of the image where the manipulation occurred,\u201d said Roy-Chowdhury.A deep neural network is what AI researchers call computer systems that have been trained to do specific tasks, in this case, recognize altered images. These networks are organized in connected layers; \u201carchitecture\u201d refers to the number of layers and structure of the connections between them.While this might fool the naked eye, when examined pixel by pixel, the boundaries of the inserted object are different.For example, they are often smoother than the natural objects. By detecting boundaries of inserted and removed objects, a computer should be able to identify altered images. The researchers tested the neural network with a set of images it had never seen before, and it detected the altered ones most of the time. It even spotted the manipulated region.\u201cIf you can understand the characteristics in a still image, in a video it\u2019s basically just putting still images together one after another,\u201d explained Roy-Chowdhury in a paper published in the journal IEEE Transactions on Image Processing.\u201cThe more fundamental challenge is probably figuring out whether a frame in a video is manipulated or not\u201d.Roy-Chowdhury, however, thinks we still have a long way to go before automated tools can detect \u201cdeepfake\u201d videos in the wild.Even a single manipulated frame would raise a red flag.\u201cThis is kind of a cat and mouse game. This whole area of cybersecurity is in some ways trying to find better defense mechanisms, but then the attacker also finds better mechanisms.","category":"tech"},{"title":"TikTok working on Instagram-like grid layout, explore feed","article":"The wildly popular short video-sharing app TikTok is reportedly mulling to launch a host of new features that seem to have been inspired by Facebook-owned Instagram.The features were discovered by reverse-engineering specialist Jane Manchun Wong who posted screengrabs of the features on Twitter.The purported Instagram-inspired features include a grid-style layout, an account switcher and a Discover page, among others.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re always experimenting with new ways to improve the app experience for our community,\u201d the spokesperson was quoted as saying by the TechCrunch on Saturday.The TikTok spokesperson, however, declined to offer further details about the company\u2019s plans but confirmed the features were things the company is working on.Earlier this week, speculation was rife that social networking giant Facebook was preparing the launch of a serious competitor to TikTok.Owned by a Beijing-based start-up named ByteDance, TikTok saw its first-time installs grow about 28 per cent year-over-year for the first half of 2019 to nearly 344 million globally despite a two-week ban in India during the second quarter (Q2), revealed an estimate by mobile app intelligence firm Sensor Tower.","category":"tech"},{"title":"Twitter to soon give context on unavailable tweets","article":"You will soon be able to know why certain tweets go unavailable in your conversation thread on Twitter.

Once a user has entered their payment information, the app not only remembers it, but also removes the choice to swap back to Google Play for future purchases, he wrote.\u201cThis is a huge difference,\u2019 Schachter said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly high-margin business for Google bringing in billions of dollars,\u2019 he said.The shares of Tinder\u2019s parent company, Match Group Inc., spiked 5% when Schachter\u2019s note was published on Thursday. Shares of Google parent Alphabet Inc. were little changed.Apple and Google launched their app stores in 2008, and they soon grew into powerful marketplaces that matched the creations of millions of independent developers with billions of smartphone users. In exchange, the companies take as much as 30% of revenue. The app economy is expected to grow to $157 billion in 2022, according to App Annie projections.As the market expands, a growing revolt has been gaining steam over the past year. Spotify Technology SA filed an antitrust complaint with the European Commission earlier this year, claiming the cut Apple takes amounts to a tax on competitors. Netflix Inc. has recently stopped letting Apple users subscribe via the App Store and Epic Games Inc. said last year it wouldn\u2019t distribute Fortnite, one of the world\u2019s most popular video games, through Google Play.Match declined to answer questions about whether the company was also investigating bypassing Apple\u2019s App Store. Match is expected to discuss the payment flow change with analysts and investors during its next earnings call on August 6.\u201cAt Match Group, we constantly test new updates and features to offer convenience, control and choice to our users,\u2019 Justine Sacco, a spokeswoman for Match, wrote in an email. \u201cWe will always try to provide options that benefit their experience and offering payment options is one example of this.\u2019Google didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.Tinder\u2019s move could spark a domino effect.Of the high-profile companies that have shunned the App store, Match is the only one that has changed the payment method in-app, Schachter noted. Others have instead forced subscribers back to their own websites to enter payment information.\u201cTinder is relatively small and it won\u2019t have a massive impact, but the concern is if this grows and gets into gaming apps as it starts moving forward,\u2019 Schachter said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see a lot of other companies potentially trying to experiment with this.\u2019\u00a0","category":"tech"},{"title":"Asus ROG\u2009Phone 2 to Black Shark 2 Pro: New gaming phones launching this month","article":"The smartphone gaming scene is about to get very exciting.
